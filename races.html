        <h2>TT Race Classes</h2>

        <p>There are several different classes of races that are run each year at the TT, with different
            characteristics.  Here's a listing of the race classes our visualization shows currently (note that we
            are not including certain classes currently, including the Sidecar A / B races, etc.)</p>

        <!-- RAN OUT OF TIME!  we will include the list of race classes for project 3 -->
