    <h2>The Tragic Side of The Isle of Man TT: Rider Casualties</h2>

    <div id="viz1">Rider Deaths by Race Class</div>

    <div id="viz2">Rider Deaths by Years of Experience at TT</div>

    <div id="viz3">Rider Deaths by Course Location</div>

    <p>These charts show the tragic side of the Isle of Man TT - the horrible loss of life.  To date 239 riders have
        lost their lives in competitive racing at the Isle of Man TT.  One of our goals for this project was to learn
        more about what the circumstances were surrounding these rider's deaths from the data (we mined this data from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Snaefell_Mountain_Course_fatal_accidents">Wikipedia</a>) and to
        come up with some sensible suggestions for ways the Isle of Man TT race officials can make improvements (both
        regulatory changes and practical changes) that will enhance the safety of all competitors at the race.</p>
    <p>In the chart to the upper left, you can see rider deaths based on Race Class.  To find out more about each race
        class, simply mouseover the race class title on the <a href="index.html">Main</a> page and a tooltip will tell
        you more about that particular class.  There are a few interesting observations to be drawn from this chart.
        The first is that the most deaths at the Isle of Man TT occur during <b><i>Practice</i></b> races, not even
        during the actual events themselves.  This speaks to the inexperience of some riders, as well as the need to
        better structure the Practice sessions (e.g., more race stewards being available for faster rider assistance
        in Practice sessions in the event of a crash, etc.).  Following the Practice race class, the Senior TT and
        Junior TT come in at positions 2 and 3 respectively for the largest number of rider deaths, followed very
        closely with the Sidecar TT.  This is unsurprising as the Senior TT and Junior TT typically ride bikes with
        the largest engines, most cyclinders, and highest horespower and speed - competitors in those races regularly
        set lap time speed records because the motorcycles they race are machines tuned to the epitome of motorsport
        capability.  Sidecar TT is also an extremely difficult and dangerous class because it involves two riders; one
        taking the role of throttle control and part of the steering job, with the riding partner responsible for
        literally leaning his or her body all the way to the ground across the entire body of the bike to keep the bike
        on track when negotiating a corner.</p>
    <p>Based on these observations, we would make the following recommendations to improve the safety of the TT:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enforce a rule whereby competitors must first prove themselves capable and sufficiently proficient in
            lower-speed race classes (such as Lightweight and Ultra-lightweight) for a period of several years of
            competition before allowing them to compete in the most dangerous classes (Senior TT, Junior TT, Sidecar)</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>In the bottom-left hand corner chart, we can see the frequency of rider deaths by course location.  The Snaefell
        Mountain Course is actually simply a connection of ancient country roads along the Isle of Man, where farmers
        and tradesmen would frequently travel.  As such, the roads are extremely narrow, often tree-lined, and there
        are many stone walls lining large portions of the couse that demarcate property borders of farmers and
        ranchers.</p>
    <p>The course has always been fraught with danger, but we recommend the following common-sense changes be made to
        improve the safety of these most-dangerous portions of the track:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Add barrier walls made of tires or other equivalent density materials along the brick walled course
            borders at all locations from Ballagarey Corner through Rhencullen</li>
        <li>Investigate options for widening the circuit track along the corners at those locations</li>
        <li>Employ additional race stewards and medical personnel at those locations</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>Finally, in the chart on the right hand side, we show perhaps the most interesting chart of all - rider
        casualties based on years of experience racing in the Isle of Man TT races.  Riders with experience ranging
        from their very first TT race to three years of TT racing had the overwhelming majority of the number of
        deaths.  There seems to be quite a drop-off in the likelihood of rider death occurrences once a rider has
        reached 7 or more years of experience.</p>
    <p>Based on this chart, we recommend the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enforce all riders to provide repeated, demonstrated copetitive experience at other similar caliber
            motorcycle road racing circuits (such as the Northwest 200 or Southwest 100 road races in Ireland, etc.)
            before allowing them to compete at the Isle of Man TT.</li>
    </ul>
