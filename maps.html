        <div class="quotation">
            <p><i>The Snaefell Mountain Course or Mountain Course is a road-racing street circuit used for the Isle of Man TT
                and Manx Grand Prix Races held in the Isle of Man from 1911 and 1923 respectively. The racing is held on
                public roads closed for racing by an Act of Tynwald (the parliament of the Isle of Man). It is the oldest
                motor-cycle racing circuit still in use.</i></p>
            <p><i>The course is 37.733 miles (60.73 km) in length and the start-line is situated on the A2 Glencrutchery Road
                in the town of Douglas. The racing circuit is based on a number of public roads on the Isle of Man
                including the primary A2 Douglas to Ramsey road, A1 Douglas to Peel road, A3 Castletown to Ramsey Road
                and the primary A18 Snaefell Mountain Road. The highest point of the course is situated on the primary A18
                Mountain Road between the Bungalow and Hailwood's Height at spot height 422 metres (1,385 ft) above sea
                level ( 54°14′47.47″N 4°27′57.18″W).</i></p>
        </div>

        <p>The Mountain Course is a notoriously difficult and challenging course, and conventional wisdom is that
            it takes anywhere from 3 - 10 years of racing on the course to become proficient (this range was taken
            as a direct quote from both the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698010/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">TT3D:
                Closer To The Edge</a> documentary, as well as a BBC ITV4 documentary
            <a href="http://www.touchline.tv/tv/motorsport/manx-grand-prix-documentary-on-itv4">Grand Prix
                Racer</a>).</p>
        <p>This difficulty, combined with the fact that over 230 riders have lost their lives on the course, made us
            interested in visualizing how long it actually takes for riders to become proficient on the course.</p>
