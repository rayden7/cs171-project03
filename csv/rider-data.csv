He was popular with the fans - especially the ladies! He made his TT debut in the 1965 Junior on an MV 350 three cylinder finishing third. The Italian star rode in just 16 TT races, won ten and retired just three times, finishing in the top three on other occasions, all on MV Agustas. He completed a Senior/Junior double in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972.  He won the 350 and the 500 Championships in 1972 bringing his total World titles to twelve. He won the 500 World title again in 1975 then retired at the end of the 1976 season. During his TT  years Agostini gave the crowds many thrilling races and he is especially remembered for the spectacular battle between himself and Hailwood in the Diamond Jubilee Senior TT. Although Ago retired with a broken chain on the fifth lap, it was a special and historic race, and one which saw all records smashed.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c91e981be5689ca9b09b1cc7b1c03aea.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/61a444122fd7d44783112cb494a2e688.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/0dade3ab4c4287c2b8f9209eebb70397.jpg,,,,10,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

1171,Dario Ambrosini,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=1171&filter=A,N,"Dario Ambrosini had three ambitions in his racing career: to win an Italian national championship, to gain a world championship and to win a TT race.The Italian achieved all three, winning the Italian 250cc title in 1947; the other aims came along twelve months later  the TT first followed by the world crown.Born in 1918, be began racing in 1937 on a 250 Benelli, the marque he was instrumental in putting on the  racing map in his brief career.Visiting the Pesaro factory in 1948, he was dismayed to learn that the only racing machines available were the 1939 models, but his ambitions and the renewed enthusiasm of the Benelli brothers new models were produced for the start of the season, where a fairy-tale win was achieved at the first Grand Prix of the year. Ambrosini went to be runner up in the 48 championship.With new models for the 1949 world championships, the TT was included in the race programme.He approached his Island debut with his usual thoroughness and set off in the massed start race behind the Guzzi riders, which were his main opposition. In fifth place as he approached Governors Bridge at the end of the first of seven laps he dropped the red Benelli, injuring an arm which forced his retirement. He finished the season as runner-up in the 250cc world championship.Nineteen Fifty was to be the Italians year as the fruition of his dreams were realised.The Lightweight TT began again as a massed start and Ambrosini completed the first of the seven laps in 5th position a minute behind the race leaders.As the race progressed he upped the pace and pulled back lost time on leader Maurice Cann, starting the final lap a mere 15 seconds adrift.Timing his attack to perfection, he passed his rival on the descent of the Mountain to take the chequered flag by 0.2 second to become only the second Italian to win a Tourist Trophy Race.Dario went on to win the 1950 250cc World Championship.Three Grand Prix wins were achieved prior to the arrival in the Isle of Man for the 1951 TT, the second round of the 51 Championships. The race had become a traditional staggered start and over four laps of the Snaefell Course and was pipped at the post by Tommy Wood on the rival Guzzi make by 8.4 seconds. He completed the season in third place in the world title chase.Tragically, he was killed during official practice for the French Grand Prix at Albi.",,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

With a huge van, generally driven by his wife Jill, he joined the Continental circus and raced all over Europe.<br /><br /> Nortons brilliant team builder, Joe Craig soon spotted him, and in 1952 realised his initial objective by joining the Norton squad. When Geoff Duke left Norton for Gilera in 1953, Amm took over as team leader.<br /><br />He was a fiercely determined rider. What he lacked in style he made up for in total dedication and sheer bravery. His assault on the Isle of Man in that first year as team leader was memorable, and brought him the Junior and Senior TT double, only the fifth rider to that time to achieve the distinction in one year. With almost total disregard for personal safety, he thundered after Geoff Duke's Gilera in the Senior event. He caught and passed him on the Mountain climb and descent, breaking course and lap records on his way to victory. His third and fastest lap at 97.41mph was almost 3mph faster than Duke's previous record.<br /><br />  In the Junior that year he led all the way to finish in record time. Good performances in Holland and Belgium helped him to third place in the 350cc-world championship. On the Island the following year he almost repeated his double of '53. In the Junior event, riding the 'Proboscis' Norton (so named for its peculiarly shaped forward-projecting frontal fairing), he led until the last lap, when the engine failed and he was robbed of certain victory. Earlier he had pushed his own 350ce lap-record up to 94.61mph. In the Senior, which turned out to be one of the wettest post-war TTs, Amm led the field, including Duke on the Gilera, when the race was dramatically abandoned after 151 miles. Again he set the fastest lap, at 89.82mph.<br /><br />  Ray Amm was doggedly patriotic and repeatedly turned down temptingcontracts from the Italian factories, preferring to ride only Britishmachines. For a couple of seasons he was the only Norton rider able to challenge the superiority of his former team mate Geoff Duke on the fast, multi-cylinder Gilera, and against almost overwhelming odds managed to secure runner-up positions in both the 350cc and 500cc world championships of 1954.<br /><br />  But as the tide turned completely against the single-cylinder Nortons, his passion to win took priority. Reluctantly he signed for the Italian MV Agusta factory, but tragically his career was almost at an end. In his first race for MV, in the 350cc event at Imola on Easter Monday, 1955, he crashed on a slippery second-gear corner and was killed.<br /><br />  In his brief, but memorable career, (he was 29 when he died) he had taken the 'kneeler' Norton to Montlhery in 1953 and captured the One Hour record at 133.71mph - over 6mph faster than Piero Taruffi's record of 1939 set on a supercharged Gilera! Earlier he established for Norton a new 350cc lap record at the North West 200 event in Northern Ireland, before having to retire on lap three.<br /><br />Slim and religious, Ray Amm had a fearless and abandoned style whichproduced many palpitating moments. Racing obsessed him and the late Bob McIntyre once said: 'I never heard him talk of anything else. A true gentleman, he was deeply respected for his skills, devotion and outstanding courage. Doubtless his tragic death was a great loss to motor cycle racing. <br /><br />Our sincere thanks to David A Russell for providing this biography of Ray Amm.<br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b34a7cc798a9713df1ce333669e700a5.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/bf7c9fa1c1c133a2d3cc99e3ff022ab4.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/1c0d50dda7d037214dc8256ef704b541.jpg,,,,3,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Velocette, Norton, NSU, DKW and Guzzi machines in a racing career which started in 1937 and continued with the exception of the war years until his retirement at the end of the 1954 season. Making his TT debut in 1939 on a brace of German DKW machines, he didnt exactly set the Island alight retiring in the Junior and finishing the Senior in 28th place.It was to be a long twelve years before his presence was seen on the Isle of Man again in the Lightweight TT, this time on an Italian Guzzi machine. Again he was unlucky retiring during the race.What a difference twelve months makes  setting new race [83.82 mph] and lap [84.82 mph] records he headed home his team-mates, Enrico Lorenzetti and Syd Lawton.Repeating the feat in 1953 with another race [84.73 mph] and lap [85.52 mph] in the Lightweight Race he held off German riders, Werner Haas on the NSU and Siegfried Wunsche on a DKW.Anderson was also third in the Junior TT behind Norton teamsters Ray Amm and Ken Kavanagh.Having won the 350cc World Championship in 1953, Fergus had three races at the 1954 TT, Lightweight, Junior and Senior, all on the Italian Guzzis.Finishing 5th in the Lightweight, the remainder of the week was one to forget as he retired in both of his other rides.Despite this setback, he went on to win his second 350cc World title and retired from racing, becoming director of Moto Guzzis competition department.Taking to the circuits again in 1956, he was killed at an International meeting at Floreffe in France, riding a 500cc BMW.

He had arrived!Riding for the Velocette factory in 1950, he retired in the Junior and took sixth in the Senior.Back on AJS machines for the 1951 TT, this time factory models, he was vying for third place in the Junior when the chain snapped at Cronk-ny-Mona, he managed to cruise to Governors then dismounted and pushed in to take 23rd place. Further disappointment was to follow in the Senior when he was forced to retire.For 1952, Armstrong was signed up by Joe Craig to ride works Nortons as back-up rider for Geoff Duke. He did not let either himself, Duke or the team down coming 2nd in the Junior and winning the Senior at 92.97 mph. [Geoff took the Junior honours and took 2nd in the Senior.]Nineteen Fifty-three was to see both Norton team-mates move over to the Italian Gilera concern.It was to be a dramatic Senior debut on the four-cylinder machine for Armstrong holding second place behind his team mate; then Duke falls at Quarterbridge, putting the Dubliner into pole position. After refuelling, he is down to 2nd, as the last lap starts. Then the chain starts to slip on the Acore bike, leaving Reg to nurse the ailing machine home in third place.1954 saw Reg retain his ride with the Acore factory, but also rode for the German NSU concern in the 250cc class, where he finished 3rd in what was a NSU benefit 1,2,3.Foul weather greeted riders for the Senior TT and racing was delayed until 12 noon, when conditions slightly improved to allow riders to get away. However, it was soon to deteriorate to such an extent that the race to stopped at the conclusion of the fourth of the scheduled six laps. Armstrong was credited with fourth place.Reg and Geoff were in a class of their own in the 1955 Senior TT, with Reg backing his team leader to the chequered flag.The 1955 racing concluded and Reg Armstrong announced his retirement from International Racing.Never far from his sport, Reg was invited to become team manager of the new Honda Racing team in 1962  a task he enjoyed and the results attained speak for themselves.He was tragically killed in a road accident when his car skidded off the road in November 1979; he was just 52 years old.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/39e3ccc51a6e3d1073dbb8f16c3d50ea.jpg,,,,,,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

7494,Robert J Bardwell,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=7494&filter=B,N,"* Started Schoolboy Moto-X aged 10.* Six year fairly successful (consistent top 3 finisher) schoolboy clubcareer.* At age 16, started riding on the streets.* Was mechanic for Martin Crooks for 3 years, including at Manx.* Took up roadracing aged 22.* Fairly successful at club level (Aintree &amp; Formula 5 meetings) with manytop 3 placings.* First Manx 1987, tried very hard, couldn't go quicker however hard Itried. Decided that the roads were not for me, went out on Thursdayafternoon for a relaxed ride around. Went two minutes quicker. It suddenlydawned on me the way to go fast, is smooth and to carry corner speed! (I hadread all the books that told me so but it didn't sink in)* Steadily went faster and faster, loved the challenge of the circuit, wentout in every session I could rain or shine.* Ran exclusively on Crooks Suzuki's (except 1995 Yamaha in Junior).* Moved up to Senior in 1989 on GSXR750, usually top Suzuki finisher inSenior for next 5 years. Every RC30 beaten was a feather in the cap!* 1990 hit rock face at Ballig on first lap, finished 22nd and gained SilverReplica. Post race went to hospital and discovered I'd broken a shoulder.(Ain't adrenaline a wonderful thing!)* 1995 tried the Junior as well as the Senior, as the new GSXR750 had notappeared, on a stock Yamaha FZR600R. Amazingly the 600 was like an armchairto ride after the GSXR and I immediately went quicker on the 600. Inpractice I was over a minute quicker than anyone in the rain. In the race, Iran out of fuel coming into pits and pushed the last 100 yards. Was laying3rd circulating with Ricky Mitchell when it highsided at Greeba Castle. Atrip in the helicopter and a six hour operation later I had nearly lost myleft leg. Decided to retire.* 1995 pain had gone away and re-visited the Manx. In Junior practice on aGSXR600WV, it ceased on the exit of Glen Vine knocking me out and breakingmy wrist, bike written off after it caught fire. RETIRED* Do some teaching at track days these days just to keep my hand in.Rob Bardwell",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 2000 he entered the six lap TT Formula 1 and Senior Races, the four lap Singles Race and the three lap Production Race on Ducatis. He has won 10 silver and four bronze TT replicas and finished 2nd in the 1997 Singles race. In 1999 he was holding second place in the Singles when he retired on the third lap, but he won a silver replica for 13th in the Production Race. He has also scored a victory at Daytona in 1999 and has finished third inthe European Supermono Cup.<br /><br />""I first met John Barton at the 1981 Manx Grand Prix where his stepfather Rupert Murden was taking part, over the next year I became a frequent visitor to their home in Gravesend as our friendship developed. The next year I started my own efforts of racing in the Manx, occasionally turning in a spectacular performance, notably at the Nook in the 1988 Junior MGP and in the 1994 Junior Classic MGP at Greeba Bridge! I remember very well in 1982 a young Johnny and his pal Lance terrorising the Paddock Hotel with catapults. When it was time for my mechanic ""Paddy"" and I to go for our tea Johnny had let the air out of one of the tyres and then when we finally got going he rode around the paddock on the bonnet of my old Avenger Estate before jumping in the car and arriving at our digs and calling out to Flo (the landlady), ""Hello Auntie Flo, I'm here for my tea"", incredibly she gave him a meal just for his cheek!Never at this time did I ever think that John would go on to be a very successful ""Privateer"" in the TT, leading the Singles for two years on the trot only to breakdown. He has been a very under estimated rider who would have gone a lot further had he been able to get more support further up in the ladder, he has been lucky to have Rupert and his mother Anne behind to help him achieve the high standard he has.""-{kindly submitted by Barry Clay}",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/1be3d4f81d696e6884e07cc3b41c22f2.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d98d3b92e60a3d856eb6506c0eb1737d.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/fdbfeab71907af9fe27b44237a082560.jpg,,,,0,1,1,0,2,1,0,2,0,0,3,1,2,1,1,1,0,2,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He followed his older brother into motorcycling and, after an apprenticeship on small machines [a Triumph Terrier 150, which was tuned to go somewhat faster than Meriden intended, comes to mind], he graduated to a B32 Gold Star which he rode in many events.In 1965 he rode his Greeves Silverstone 250 in the Lightweight Manx Grand Prix to 44th place.In 1967 Martin emigrated to Australia, initially to Sydney and later to Perth where he set up a successful business retailing and fitting home heating.In Western Australia he was a keen competitor in the 125cc class until the class was abolished some time in the late 70s, early 80s.Martin so loved the Isle of Man racing scene that he named his sons after place names on the island, Ramsey and Braddan.He died of a heart attack on October 30th 1993 while working on his land at Walpole, Western Australia. He was aged 53. Martin left a wife Wendy and two sons.Thanks to Bryan and Margaret Beames of New Zealand who provided the above information and photograph.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b689312bc8bdfb298e34217d7c27b480.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Artie had a short but brilliant TT career which saw him fail to finish just once, in his very first race, the 1947 Junior. However his road racing talents were obvious as he took second in the Senior that same year!  Still on works Nortons in 1948, he won the Senior and finished third in the Junior. For 1949 it was third in the Junior and fourth in the Senior, then in his last year 1950, he won the Junior and took second place in the Senior. A terrific competitor, when Artie raced it took something special to beat him. A promising career was cut short with a heavy accident in the 1950 Belgian Grand Prix and many are convinced his successes at the TT could have been even greater.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c3a74dd95f18f19779df58270045365c.jpg,,,,,,2,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He always claimed to me that he wasfaster than the 'works' Nortons and despite them offering him a new bikein exchange for his, he refused and was denied a better result by a stuckgear change mechanism.  I still have a cigarette case presented to myfather by Norton Motors ""In recognition of a splendid performance"" in therace.""<br /><br /> He was working for W O Bentley at the time and had recently mechaniced forthe Bentley team at Le Mans.  He returned to the Island with the Bentleyteam later for the Car TTs.<br /><br />He returned to the Island in 1925 on a P &amp; M.  I have no details on how hedid.  AlI can remember him telling me was that he was so broke on thereturn ride home (yes on the same bike!) that he had to push it home toNorth London from Luton!<br /><br />I have some photographs of him racing on the Island.<br /><br />   He went on to race bikes and cars at Brooklands and on the continent,including many endurance car events (Le Mans, Mille Miligia etc).<br /><br />  I well remember him warning me of the dangers of the TT course when I toldhim I was going to compete there.  (And that from someone who racedpre-war at Brooklands and on open roads on the Island!)<br /><br />His replica won in 1923 went missing during a house move to Spain and Iwould dearly love to obtain a copy of a replica of the period to sitalongside my replica from the 1998 MGP on the mantelpiece.<br /><br /><br /><br />Yours in sportAlan Bezzant<br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Educated at Reed's School in Cobham, Surrey, leaving in 1958 with 7 GCE ""O"" Level. Worked with C.A.Parsons &amp; Co. Ltd. at the Heaton Works in Newcastle from September 1958 until December 1976. I took up road racing in 1966, and enjoyed club racing that year. I got my national license for 1967, and had many races in Scotland as well as most of the English tracks. Got my International license in 1968 and had 2 years as a ""shoestring"" rider before getting married in 1969. An immediate family resulted in my quitting the racecircuit at the end of 1969. In January 1977 I emigrated with my family to Canada where I still live. I am currently Chief Building Official for the City of Kenora, Ontario, on Lake of the Woods. I now enjoy fishing and I am currently restoring a 1976 Honda Goldwing GL1000 to as near stock as I can afford.

I would like to know how Amanda Sheard acquired that photo, was she at the 67 or perhaps her father? <br /><br />The reason I found this Web Site was I was actually looking for additional info on Stan myself, I'm sure there are a couple of photos of Stan and Mike Hailwood together from the 67 TT, as they bumped into each other at several circuits over several years, and became quite friendly.  <br /><br />I will dig up some more info and pass on in the near future; in the meantime if anyone has access to any further stats and pictures of Stan I would be interested to view same. <br /><br />Stan is my Stepfather and as bad as it sounds I have not seen him for a couple of years, I have been talking in recent months about making the trek to visit with him where he lives in the country. <br /><br /><br /><br />Robert Gartland<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/1525fc73f8fad64e4ce97c0eb0a5447b.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

2814,Roger Bowler,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=2814&filter=B,N,"Roger, whose full name was Roger David Bowler, was born in March 1944, in London, to Mr. and Mrs. Fred Bowler. During the  period I knew him, they lived in various flats in North London, moving to Redhill and then to Crawley by the mid 1960s. After school he spent a short time working as a post office engineer, but moving on to work as a civilian mechanic at a REME depot near Crawley, up until the time we last met in early 1970. Roger had an incredible sense of humour with an ability to deflate pomposity. I also remember him for his single-minded (perhaps bloody-minded) pursuit of motorcycles, motorcycling and motorcycle racing. <br /><br />Roger's first motorbike was a 250 cc BSA C10 of doubtful age purchased in about 1961. A 1958 600c Norton Dominator quickly replaced it. His serious racing career started in 1966 on my 1960 500cc Velocette. His first ever win was on this bike in 1966 at Brands Hatch. <br /><br />He also entered a few sprint events riding my 1932 250cc Rudge, but without success. 1966 also saw his first entry into the MGP. He entered his Dominator, by now fitted with a 500cc motor. He did not race as the bike blew-up in practice. Shortly after this, he was sponsored on both Husquavarna's and Triumphs. Unfortunately, <br /><br />I cannot remember the name of his sponsor. It was a Triumph dealer not too far from his Crawley residence. Roger did introduce us during that last visit in 1970, and I remember a very thoughtful and humorous gentleman who treated me very well, but unfortunately, his name escapes me. <br /><br /><br /><br />Information kindly provided by Ian Simpson<br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

He will need to increase his best ever lap by almost 4mph in the Superbike races in order to win but expect to see the Enniskillen man on the podium, at least, in the Junior and Superstock events.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/786e4101c56ff9c983bc64119cb6e5db.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/cc12ff49ebb9ece4b5ab2941688f3bd1.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/baece7f6a89a45da0bb3ac4e3a0ab800.jpg,,,,0,1,1,4,2,4,3,2,1,1,0,2,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

3371,Fred Broadbent,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=3371&filter=B,N,"I am now living in the beautiful Fingers Lake area about 250 miles from New York City, United States of America. Married to the local school principal. Brought with me some of my classic bike collection. A 1957 Square Four, 1960 Norton Dominator, a 1972 BMW ""Special"" and a Triumph Trials bike which I used in a ""British Trial"" here recently. But... it was the only Brit. bike there! Also have 5 more bikes here. Lots of Harley's here.. Hmmm. Put in the fastest lap in practice for the 77 MGP, it was my first ride on a TZ and knew little about them. I altered jets and ignition for the race. This will live with me forever as it lost 20 m.p.h. in top speed on race day, MY mistake, finished 10th with my chain jumping the sprockets on the last lap. Happy days. Did TT 2 years later on my little home built Suzuki. It handled great, was reliable but oh so slow. However it was the 3rd 250 machine to finish the Formula 3-world championship race. We had to race against 400cc 4 stokes though. In my time I raced 250's, 350's, 500's, 750's, Production, Formula 3 and Vintage on Ariel's and a Velocette. Started on a Norton Atlas, then rode the other Jim Lee Commando on which I had some wins on northern circuits. Mick Grant rode the other one. I once hit the monument at Scarborough (literally) as I slid across the grass trying to catch Mick up in practice.If any of the guys I raced against are in my area over here, call me up.

Jack his father had bought the Beeza off local road racer Roger Corbett in 1963and the young Browning showed great promise on the machine, to such am extent that a new Greeves Silverstone was purchased.<br /><br />1965 saw him sponsored on a Gloucester built Cotton Telstar gaining many wins in the process, eventually being poached by the Herring Yamaha team, going on to win the British 250cc Championship.<br /><br />Daves father bought him a 500cc Manx Norton, he also had outings on such exotica as the Egli Vincent and Alpha Centuri!<br /><br />As well as all the British short circuits and the TT races, he rode many international circuits.<br /><br />A most memorable ride was an endurance race in Alicante in Spain, despite falling off his Cotton Conquest he kicked his machine straight and went on to finish, The Spanish crowd was so taken with his entertaining ride they raised money for the repair of the bike!<br /><br /> A car accident in 1974 left Dave with serious head injuries stopping many more years of his promising racing career. Cotswold Headway did much to bring back Dave to some normality, with him running their newsletter for many years.<br /><br />Dave Browning, 59, died of a massive heart attack 4th April 2004. <br /><br />George Ridgeon<br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

Had Keith been more experienced, better results would have been obtained. The Velo was then sold so that he could finance his first trip to the U.K. in 1953.A pair of Nortons, 350 &amp; 500, were used in the Isle of Man and the ""Continental Circus"".Returning to Australia at the end of the 1953 season and the set-up was repeated in 1954, however Keith crashed on the first lap of practice at the Ulster, breaking his shoulder and collarbone.       He returned home and was fit enough by then to ride in the first 24hour race at Mount Druitt, the team winning the 650cc. class. The same team competed in 1955 with the same results.       By this time Keith was married to Gwen and both  returned to England, in 1956, collected two Nortons and did the ""Circus"" and the Island., staying over there during the winter to be on hand for the 1957 season. In the TT he rode the factory AJS and Matchless machines for Tom Arter and Bob Foster respectfully. Then after the Dutch TT, Moto Guzzi asked Keith Bryen to try one of their 350cc. machines at the Belgian Grand Prix. Subsequently signing up with them in time for the Ulster and Italian Grands Prix.      History records that most of the factories retired from racing at the end of `57, and with their daughter Stephanie arriving in December that year, Keith and Gwen decided  it wiser to settle down and concentrate on family life.       Those years of racing are always foremost in our minds and Keith is thankful that together, we often recall little incidents of that era.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/4ee9bfc1674a972aae06c7f5dd16fa17.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/0b65570061b77085525b8edf3a42da31.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/863e9b95ad202634bb710aff3fc55e1f.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

8279,Robert Burns,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=8279&filter=B,N,"Name: Robert Burns<br /><br />Age: 38 [2002]<br /><br />Location: Stoke Newington, North London (originally Roseyards, Ballymoney)<br /><br />Occupation: Freelance Computer Network Consultant and Trainer (MCT, CNI) Tel 07973 248 895 rob_burns99@hotmail.com <br /><br />Hi, basically Im a bit of a born again racer, started with an RD250LC, in the production class, just when the Gammas and TZRs were ruling the roost, got a bit fed up dicing for 2nd from last and stopped for a while. <br /><br />Came back to play, when the EXUP came out and what a beautiful bike it was, really easy to ride. Started to win a few races in my second season, and ended up winning the club championships for the next two years, much to Ian Rogers chagrin. <br /><br />Time for a rebuild, so I thought that one cylinder would be cheaper to run than four (was I wrong), built a Harris Supermono DR800.My mechanical skills came on leaps and bounds, thanks mostly to the patience of Dave Morris, as he helped me out of one hole after another.My racing however went into reverse, except for running 6th in the Supermono at Donington when everyone else fell off in the wet. <br /><br />It did give me my first taste of real road racing, I got out to play with the supermonos at the course I went to as a boy, the North West 200 and qualified 6th, and guess what also blew up whilst in 6th on the first lap of the race, seizing at the end of the Portrush straight. <br /><br />Gave that up as a bad job and got a 95 ex V&M; Honda 600, and messed about in the Supercup series, though my performances were anything but. Had a ride at another of my haunts as a boy, the Ulster Grand Prix and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. <br /><br />Then suffered a 5-year hiatus, as money was a bit scarce after I got divorced. Intended entering the MGP in 2000 ago, but went snowboarding for the first time and lasted about 20 minutes before dislocating my shoulder and ripping tendons and ligaments left right and centre, no MGP that year and then some silly cows ruined for the next and now I have finally found out how steep Bray Hill really is. <br /><br />I took the Honda out to the New Brighton Promenade races and realised just how quick, the 600s had got and how slow I had become. The next day the lesson was emphasised even more when I was concussed at Mallory after high siding, trying to avoid being overtaken by someone in an orange jacket. My head suffered even more than my ego. <br /><br />This years plan to regain my national, was get an MZ, nice and cheap, just finish in the top half of the field and get my licence back and stop. Well you know how it is, started going ok, averaging about sixth, good dicing and great fun. The MZ was brought up to the latest specification. all ready for a crack at the remaining rounds, until I counted how much money I didn't have.  She is now up for sale at the ridiculously low rate of 1500, so you can go out and get on the podium instead of me. <br /><br />I now have a nice new bog standard GSXR600 (5000 ono), which was run in round the Island and even remembered it's way round there quite nicely. I managed a 106.97 last lap on the senior.  Thanks to Keith McKay and Harry Harrison for their course advice and Giselle for putting up with endless video laps.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks to Rob for providing the above information.",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A 'comfortable' machine, but with no top speed, he nevertheless managed to be placed on the Leader Board twice during practice, despite only managing a top speed of 93mph on Sulby Straight.<br /><br />Tactics on Race Day included a Pit Stop at the end of the first lap, to carry less weight at the end of the race. Overshot pit by 60-metres, when in 3rd position with a time of 28m 36s. Dropped to 16th on lap 2 due to the pit delay time.<br /><br />Back on the Leader Board in 6th position at the end of the third lap, improving all the way along the course on the final lap, climbing the Mountain in second or third place, only to 'find' some loose gravel at the Stonebreakers Hut and crash!<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks to Peter for his TT Experience.<br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/4945a21b0fb3e35ad3e43f5cf7726533.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The Matchless people didn''t say much, but gave him 4 modified rockers to fit, which cured the problem. <br /><br />My Mother tells me that the winter previous to his ride, they were walking home in the snow (the buses couldn''t cope with the hill on Uxbridge Road) and he told her that when he came back from the Island he would buy a ring and they would get married. <br /><br />He ran his own tool making business in Amersham, and continued mucking about with bikes until shortly before he died, mainly parading his long stroke Manx in CRMC events. <br /><br />My stepmother still has the shield he was awarded. <br /><br /><br /><br />Graham Clark.<br /><br /><br /><br />March 2006 <br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Charles was born in Plumstead.  It was probably inevitable that he would go into the sport since his father began the company H. Collier and Sons which manufactured Matchless machines from 1899.  In the opening years of the 20th century Charles made three appearances in the International Cup races and then, in 1907, riding a 431cc Matchless he won the single cylinder (unlimited capacity) class of the first Tourist Trophy.  The race was a battle between the Matchless and Triumph machines but it was also a stop-start affair with the bikes needing new plugs and belts, not to mention interruptions for punctures.   As the race moved into its fourth hour, Collier was ahead of Jack Marshall on a Triumph, and that was how they finished. Collier's fastest lap was recorded at 42.9mph.  The course itself was only just over fifteen miles long and avoided the mountain since the machines were not powerful enough to cope.  <br /><br />In the following year Collier took second place in the same single cylinder class.  This was another duel between Matchless and Triumph.  Jack Marshall took the lead but fell.  Collier went ahead but Marshall remounted, only to have a valve break while on the fourth lap.  Amazingly, he set about making a repair and rejoined the race to catch Collier and win by 2min. 10sec.<br /><br />The fifteen-mile circuit was last used in 1910.  Collier had seen his brother Harry win in 1909 (the first time single cylinder and multis appeared in the same race)and both entered in the following year.  The initial lead was taken by H.H. Bowen, riding a BAT, but he crashed into a wall to leave the brothers in the first two places.  Numerous riders crashed or had mechancial problems causing their retirement.  However, Charles Collier had a comparatively trouble-free ride on his Matchless to win in 50.63mph.<br /><br />The first Senior TT (1911) saw him chase the American board-track champion Jake de Rosier on the first lap of the new 'Mountain' course.  However, de Rossier crashed and had to make repairs.  Collier took the lead but ran out of fuel and needed to top up at an uofficial station away from the pits.  He went on to finish first but was later disqualified.  Subsequently he had three more races against de Rosier at Brooklands.  De Rosier won the first on the Indian machine he had ridden in the TT but Collier won the second.  In the final race de Rosier kept in Collier's slipstream until near the end then dashed ahead.  De Rosier greatly enjoyed the Brooklands experience and was highly impressed with Collier whom he tried to persuade to go back to the United States.  However, with the First World War approaching, Collier elected to stay in Britain but his success began to fade.  He was fourth in the 1912 Senior and rode his last TT race in 1914 when he retired on the first lap.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Norman Fox 2002<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6f6d308f5aed6a9bb08fa238f90749b3.jpg,,,,,,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

The Puch moped was a bit of an embarrassment, so I used to ride during the day with a scarf around my face so that friends wouldn't recognise me!<br /><br />I used to go to the Transatlantic Match Races at Oulton Park and dream of one day taking part in races there and in 1983 I started racing, my first race being at Flookburgh on an old Yamaha RD250B which I had bought for 125. That soon made way for a 250LC and many a good time was had (and much money spent) on that.<br /><br />Many bikes have come and gone but my favourite was a Kawasaki ZXR750 H2 on which I made my Manx Grand Prix debut in 1995 having previously come over to spanner for Joss Armer the year before. <br /><br />Prior to that I had only been over with friends on a day trip to the TT 1980 when racing was rained off and I vowed never to come back again. Good job I did because I fell in love with the place and even now when I don't compete any more have to lock myself away in a darkened room when the Grand Prix is on. <br /><br />It really is the biggest challenge for motorcyclists - on a par with Everest for climbers - so finishing was rewarding enough for me. I always treated the races as a holiday and didn't put pressure on myself.  If I got a good result, that was a bonus. <br /><br />I was lucky to have good friends to mechanic for me and I made some new and lasting ones whilst there. <br /><br />On the mainland I competed at many circuits around the country but my favourites were Oulton Park and Aintree. I have raced in many classes including 250 Proddy and Singles.<br /><br /><br /><br />Michael Connor<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c1f1b9c3c0471d4148d0e0ec4110f646.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/05994b77022ed6f37868a409c60d6912.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/a7090cfbe25bccd5064e071889f5d197.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1705,Fred Cook,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=1705&filter=C,N,"Motorcycling started for Fred at age 16 with a 1937 Ariel 350 used only on the roads.  His first competitive bike was a BSA 350 Gold Star used for road racing and scrambling (motocross). Then a 1950 AJS 7R 350 with works motor and this meant Fred could race against the top riders of the day in New Zealand.&#160;  1955 saw Fred chosen for the New Zealand TT Team with Bill Collett and John Hempleman. While Bill and John were able to get sponsored bikes, Fred had to purchase his own new 7R and Matchless G45. Sailing from New Zealand in late February, the team arrived for 3 weeks course learning before official practice started.  &#160;27<sup>th</sup> in the Junior and 18<sup>th</sup> in the Senior secured two silver replicas. Then it was off to the Continent for more races and then home to New Zealand.  Fred was selected again for the 1956 Team with Bill Aislabie and Bob Coleman (brother of Rod). Fred again used the two 1955 bikes and had the company of his older brother (Bob) as he would also be racing, but as a privateer.  Sailing from New Zealand, the team met three girls and one was to become the future Mrs Cook. Sadly, Bill Aislabie was to lose his life in the North West 200, so the TT Team was then only two.  14<sup>th</sup> in the Junior (brother Bob was 25<sup>th</sup>) and 18<sup>th</sup> in the Senior gained two more silver replicas. Further racing in Ireland followed by another Continental session followed the TT.  Sadly, during the Continental racing, Fred was to learn that brother Bob had lost his life whilst riding at Aintree circuit in England.  Back to New Zealand and after some further racing and also now married to Julie, Fred decided that dairy &#160;farming was to take over from bike racing.  A trip back to the TT in 1995, as a spectator, showed Fred the increase in speed that the bikes had gained in 40 years.  In 2012, Fred, in his 80s, was living in the Taranaki region of New Zealand and looking as fit as a 40 year old.  &#160;(Information from Fred Cook and &#160;the book Taranaki Men Talk by Alison Robinson)&#160;",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The same year I went to the Junior Manx Grand Prix and fell in love with the Isle of Man.<br /><br />A 250 Yamaha saw some good results in  1974 with several second places to Ray McCullough at Killinchy and Skerries and a sixth place at the Lightweight Manx.<br /><br />1975 saw my debut at the TT but machine problems meant poor results. The highlight of 1975 was eighth place at the Ulster Grand Prix in the 250 class. 1976 saw a bronze replica at the TT and my first 100mph laps.<br /><br />1977 was a short season due to lack of funds and in 1978 I retired from racing after a silver and bronze at the TT.<br /><br />Nowadays I compete in the veterans class in local bicycle races - less speed but plenty of fun.<br /><br /><br /><br />Donal Cormican 2003",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/78fad8478fa8dec109f90c63436b73c5.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Meanwhile John Hartle was matching the Manxmans speed, although the rain had begun to fall. When the first lap times were posted, it was shown that Ennett held a 29 second advantage over Hartle with Tait third a mere second behind Hartle, followed by Chadwick, Costain and J W Davie sixth.<br /><br />Early on the second lap Chadwick came off at Quarterbridge and although he restarted, decided to call it a day at Ballacraine. The end of lap two had Ennett leading Hartle by 68 seconds; Tait was 22 seconds down on John, as fourth to sixth places were filled by Sparrow Costain, Powell and Dennis Christian  three Manxman in the first six!<br /><br />Ennett came in to top up his petrol tank at the end of the second lap, taking less than half a minute, he was followed by the remainder of the leader board.<br /><br />The weather by this time was atrocious and was reflected in Dereks third lap time of 29 minutes 6 seconds.However, the weather did not deter Hartle, as he began to show his mastery of the conditions and by the end of the third lap he had pulled back his second lap deficit to lead by some 25 seconds from Ennett. Tait and Costain remained in third and fourth positions.<br /><br />Percy Tait was forced to retire with engine trouble at Ballahutchin Hill on his fourth lap, but not before he had shown he would be a force to be reckoned with in the future. Percys departure moved Costain to third place behind Hartle and close neighbour Ennett. Hartles lead was now 70 seconds and though Derek increased his lap speed on the fourth lap, but so did the irrepressible Hartle!<br /><br />Dereks valiant attempt to take the Senior honours came to an end on the penultimate lap, when his machine went on to one cylinder at Windy Corner  he coasted in to retire at the pits.<br /><br />Ennetts retirement left Hartle with what appeared to be an unassailable five-minute lead over Costain.<br /><br />The sixth and last lap progressed, with Sparrow leading on the roads, followed by Powell. And such was Hartles speed and persistence that he was now fifth on the roads.<br /><br />Just after 2pm George Costain received the chequered flag for what he thought was a certain second position. A matter of seconds later Powell also took the chequered flag and they and the spectators settled back to await John Hartles arrival and what appeared to be a comfortable victory.<br /><br />But John, having passed through Ramsey climbed the Mountain for the last time, in his immaculate style, and then ruthless fate took a hand as he approached the Mountain Box, the engine faulted and died  he was out of petrol!<br /><br />George Costain could not believe Johns misfortune, which of course was his good fortune, winning the race in a time of 2 hours 47 minutes 49 seconds, an average speed of 80.95mph.<br /><br />Derek Ennetts opening lap of 25 minutes 49 seconds was the fastest of the race at 87.72mph.<br /><br />The Club Team Prize went to the Southern (IoM) Club with George, Sid Mizen and Eddie Crooks as members.<br /><br />By winning the Senior and taking tenth place in the Junior, George Costain was also awarded the Lady Hill Trophy for the best performance by a Manxman. It was only his second year in the Manx having made his debut 12 months earlier in the Senior, retiring on the third lap.<br /><br />From 70 entrants, 61 started the race, 31 finished and 15 gained replicas.<br /><br />Apart from George, another three Manx riders finished in the first twelve  Dennis Christian in fourth place; Bob Dowty sixth and Eddie Crooks 12th.<br /><br /><br /><br />Compiled and written by Philip Edge - 1994<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/28b0ff042682be0d7d54c5750f6d7803.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/998cf599b4496e3c1874f94c05fa7f6b.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Ranging from RGV250s, GP250s and CB500s to Fireblades. Im currently the third fastest girl to have lapped the Isle of Man TT course  and will become the fastest.The majority of that time she has been solely responsible for all the essentials to enable her to race. Maria has generated financial backing, securing sponsorship by keeping a high profile within the press. Organising the logistics of every round with an extremely small budget and getting her hands dirty when friends were in short supply to lend a hand. Maria says it has been the most fantastic thing she ever decided to do in her life. Her approach to motorcycle racing is always energetic; the 2001 season saw her participate in British, European and World level racing. Maria pushes her boundaries to the limit while maintaining a professionalism to match her contemporaries.Maria fulfilled her ambition to compete in the European Superstock Championship on two occasions and riding at night qualifying for the World 24 Hour Endurance race will remain an experience second only to racing the TT. She competed at three separate events on three very different motorcycles an achievement in any riders career.A former veterinary nurse and now a racing journalist Maria Costello reckons that racing motorcycles has been character building and life changing and she's loved every minute of  it, and will continue to do so for a long time yet.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/1c22955e4c273a775d83c3ea966f1ef5.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d96769bcd9b2192a2f4ea90d8e0a4e02.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/75289214a43ae582cb4ca812c4657796.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,0,2,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

Completing his debut rides with a 10th in the Junior Manx Grand Prix and 3rd in the Lightweight - all on his 250cc Irish Racing Yamaha.Due to ride in the 1993 TT, his debut was postponed due to a racing spill in his native Ulster.James decided to gain more Mountain experience by entering the 1993 Manx Grand Prix. He returned home with victories in both Junior and Lightweight Grands Prix.The Crumlin man finally made his TT debut in 1994 and did not disappoint, gaining a well earned 7th place in the Junior race, although he was forced to retire in the Ultra Lightweight when the little Honda ceased to function.1995 was to prove what an up and coming road racing competitor James was, finishing 3rd in the Ultra Lightweight, 24th in the Junior and a magnificent runner-up spot to Joey Dunlop in the Lightweight race.Looking forward to 1996 all turned to doom and gloom as a pre season practice spill at Kirkistown put James out for the majority of the season.1997 look good with early season success at home. A harmless looking practice spill at the North West 200 once again prevented him from competing in the Isle of Man.Back racing at the Isle of Man for the first time since 1995, James picked up where he left off by taking a further two rostrum third positions in the Formula One and Senior TTs on the RC45 Tillstons Honda. Additionally he was 11th in the Junior and 4th in the Lightweight.1999 again got off to a good result with 4th in the opening Formula One TT, on the Reve Red Bull Ducati.Two days later disaster struck in the Lightweight TT, coming off his 250cc machine in the Lightweight Race, suffering leg injuries that took many months to heal.James was back at the TT in 2000, once again riding his Ducati taking 14th and 22nd places in the Formula One and Senior TTs.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7ba6a38470014e6044ca733b29f37eca.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/74eaa02d5bc37f96762bc3e33bb58d2f.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/039b7b83f894a05c8b8b75b1d812e3b4.jpg,,,,0,1,3,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Despite this I am so honoured to have been part of the Islands race heritage and look back with great enjoyment on my trips to the MGP and TT.<br /><br />In the later years of my racing in the late 70''s, I managed to coincide with the great Mike Hailwoods return to racing and as he had been my great hero for years, I was so proud of appearing on the grid with him at the Post TT Mallory meeting and later the Formula 1 support race at the Silverstone GP.<br /><br />At Mallory I qualified on pole on the Peckett and McNab Kawasaki and got whopped by Mike on his Ducati in the race. A pleasure to circulate behind him and see what a smooth racer he was.<br /><br />At Silverstone the late Tom Herron on the Mocheck Honda joined us and the three of us took turns to lead. The top speed of Toms and my bike proved too much for Mikes Ducati and I managed to pip Tom on the line for victory by 200th of a second.<br /><br />I shall never forget being on the podium with Tom Herron who I had great respect for, and Mike Hailwood who was the best rider I have ever seen.<br /><br />I retired in 1978 after clinching the Formula 1 title for Peckett and McNab, a superb pair of engineers and great guys, as I damaged my elbow at the season closer at Brands Hatch and now cannot bend it.<br /><br />Shortly after emigrating to Australia in 2000 my son started road racing and is currently leading the Northern Territory Club Championships and wishing he could return to Britain for the Yamaha R6 Cup. Maybe.<br /><br /><br /><br />Kind regards to all and thanks for the years of pleasure the IOM has given me.<br /><br /><br /><br />John Cowie<br /><br /><br /><br />July 2007<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/009c229fe526cf613beaa348f3b37367.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/f627b1e7f354be6a04b4aeec8101c1c0.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

My best result on the T.T. course was 8th in the 1980 MMCC Senior Newcomers Race on a 500 Kawasaki two-stroke triple<br /><br />He always campaigned 3 cylinder 2-stroke Kawasaki machines, ending up with an H2R air-cooled model, which at the time (81-82-83) was the only one being raced in the UK, all parts courtesy of Kawasaki race dept Santa Anna California, and was very special!<br /><br />Adrian  dearly loved the machine even though it was notoriously unreliable, the factory couldnt get them reliable and he ended up slotting the Kawasaki 750 engine in a superbly handling Yamaha OW31 (TZ750) Chassis.<br /><br />Best TT course lap in 1982 practice (Unofficial at 98.6mph) A member of the Andreas ""A"" team on race day although failing to complete the race  the Kwacka giving up the ghost once again.<br /><br />Threw it away big time on Bungalow Bridge in 1983 Manx Grand Prix practice, didnt ride a motorcycle again for 18 years until recently getting my hands on a beautiful but old and original Honda RC 30. (What Id have given for one of these 22 years ago!) <br /><br />I was the very last man to competitively ride a 750/3 Kawasaki on the T.T. course and would dearly love the chance to ride and hear the flat drone of the exhausts once again in the lap of honour so................please Mick Grant give me a run on your personal ex-factory H2R.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/f32738b2c2c8e7fad0d3f0877663f78e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/08b2fd1616fdc8fed4e6b95314bc03c2.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

From the Isle of Man, Nick has previously contested the TT races as a passenger in the sidecar races. In this capacity he finished 10th in 1995, 7th and 10th in 1996 and 2nd in 1998. His personal course lap record is 105mph.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>TT 2005 Detail</b>Nick CroweAge:		28TT Debut:	2002Wins:		0Podiums:	4Fastest Lap:	110.61mphTeam:		<br /><br />Another fast local driver, Crowe tasted success as a passenger at the TT, partnering Kenny Howles to 2nd place in 1998, before switching to the controls for his debut in 2002. He was on the pace immediately, posting the quickest ever lap by a Sidecar newcomer although he was forced to retire in both races. Since then, he has never been off the podium, taking four runner-up spots in the four races held since, and only Molyneux is preventing him from taking his first win. One of only four drivers to lap in excess of 110mph, he has long time friend Darren Hope in the chair and the duo will push Moly all the way.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/5a83ecc8e2db8f53e8bc07c2888c26ce.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d261d64214b189bf8bd94803fcdbb566.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6cc0ca9176e54aab25d50974aa369930.jpg,,,,5,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9

In 1938, riding a works Norton, he set the first under 25-minute (24min.52.6sec) lap of the island, which represented a speed of 91mph and was not bettered for twelve years.<br /><br />His first victorious appearance outside mainland short circuit racing had been while competing in the 1933 Manx Grand Prix.  The following year he entered the Senior TT on a works AJS.  He finished ninth and retired in the Junior race.  His period with AJS gave little indication of his ability, finishing eighth in the 1935 Junior and retiring in the Senior.  In 1936 he did no better, getting a ninth place in the Junior.  In the Senior he rode the first AJS four-cylinder machine but there were mechanical problems and he again retired.<br /><br />He left AJS and in 1937 entered the Senior with his own Steve Lancefield (his brother-in-law) tuned three-year-old Norton which at least brought him slightly more success with fifth place. He also managed fifth in the Junior.  In addition he had beaten Stanley Woods at Donington and Crystal Palace.  That year he rode his first race on the Continent, the Dutch TT, and finished second. The Norton factory, or more specifically, Joe Craig, then decided to offer him a team place for the 1938 season in which he won the Senior race and set that record lap.  However, it was only over the last few miles that he managed to overtake Stanley Woods.  <br /><br />He volunteered for Second World War service but, ironically, was rejected on the grounds of poor eyesight.  So he served in the Home Guard. When the war ended he continued with Norton, winning the Senior races of 1947 and 1949 while also riding well on the Continent and successfully on domestic short circuits, most notably Donington.  His career came to a close in 1950 when he made his last appearance on the island, finishing third in the Junior race quite a distance behind the emerging new star of the sport, Geoff Duke, who himself finished behind Artie Bell.  On retirement he became a Norton dealer in Forest Hill, London.<br /><br /><br /><br />Copyright.

Since winning the 1993 Senior Manx Grand Prix, Nigel has gone onto considerable success in the TT Races. In 1994 he was 4th in the Senior and 6th in the Formula 1 Race, the following year he scored a 6th in the Singles and a 7th in the Junior Race. 1996 brought further success with a 5th place in the Formula 1, a 6th in the Junior, a 9th in the Senior and his first TT podium finish with a 3rd in the Junior. His 1997 challenge ended with a practice spill, but Nigel was back in 1998, this time taking a magnificent 2nd in the Production, a 6th in the Senior and 14th in the Lightweight. By now a seasoned TT racer, 1999 brought further acclaim and a 4th place in the Junior, a 7th in the Formula 1 and Proddie Races, and a 9th in the Junior. 2000 gave Nigel another 7th place in the F1 Race, an 8th in the Senior and a 12th in the Production Race. Nigel - who has lapped the course at 121.78mph - says his ambitions are to win a TT race and take as much money as possible off fellow competitor Iain Duffus on the golf course!",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/29dbfdaa488b678fafc44a4baa9689f9.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/21063486b569cd19ae945b20966c8047.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/56c0605203bb47b22ffe5718e26e2c1b.jpg,,,,0,1,1,3,1,4,4,1,2,1,3,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8

He was known as Smokey because when taking part in a race at New Brighton, he was mistaken by the spectators, for the leader, who was Australian rider, Smokey Stratton. There was a lot of dust and exhaust fumes, and the riders were obscured from view.<br /><br />Leslie competed in the Ulster 100, the North West 200, and several Manx Grand Prix races. He also competed in speedway events at New Brighton, Bellevue and Rochdale. Leslie ran a garage at Heswall, Birkenhead, where he designed and built many of his own machines, and machines for fellow competitors. <br /><br />He even built a machine for his son, Barry, at a time when childrens motorcycles were unheard of. Some of his machines were known as Bitzas, because they were made up from the best bits of other machines.<br /><br />Because of injuries suffered in some of his pre-war racing crashes, Leslie was ineligible for the armed forces at the outbreak of World War 2. During the day he worked as an RAF civilian instructor, training aircraft maintenance mechanics, and at night he would roar around the blacked-out countryside on his bikes, delivering dispatches etc. <br /><br />He also did some specialised welding work as part of Frank Whittle's secret engine development team. During the war he was also building DMW kits in very limited numbers, due to the shortage of materials.<br /><br />In the early 1940s Leslie opened a small garage in Wolverhampton. It is thought to have been in the Pool Street area, near to Sunbeam land. He was an innovator and developed Dawsons Telematic tele-forks, which were launched in 1942. These were telescopic spring and pneumatic front forks in a do it yourself kit form.<br /><br />They were easily fitted to British machines, which at the time still had traditional girder forks. Telescopic suspension units were only available on expensive BMW machines, which were heavily patented so that other manufacturers could not copy the idea. The Telematic forks however, did not infringe these patents. Local customers could take their machines to Leslies garage and have the forks fitted. <br /><br />In 1943 a rear suspension conversion kit was produced, which gave a much-improved ride. The rear part of the frame was cut-off and the new kit was welded in its place.<br /><br />Leslie called his garage Dawsons Motor Works, and after the Second World War he started to build a few racing machines. These machines were the first to use the DMW name, which stood for Dawson's Motorcycles Wolverhampton. The machines were powered by 350c.c. and 500c.c. JAP engines, and were the first machines that Leslie completely built. <br /><br /><br /><br />DMW - Into Production<br /><br />During the war the products sold in relatively small numbers, but now the war was at an end the conversion kits were becoming popular with enthusiasts. Demand grew, and it became necessary to find capital to expand the business and increase production. Leslie joined forces with local businessman Harold Nock, who ran Metal Profiles Limited at Valley Road Works, Sedgley. Harold was keen to get involved in the motorcycle business and had gained a lot of experience in that area. In 1926 he worked for Howard Davies at H.R.D. and then moved to Sunbeam. After a spell with A.J.S., he went into partnership with Walter Ford, who had been one of the partners who formed Diamond Motorcycles in Sedgley Street.<br /><br /> At DMW, production was stepped-up and large numbers of suspension systems were produced. Harold proposed building a lightweight two-stroke road machine, which would sell in much larger numbers than grass-track racing machines. Leslie on the other hand felt that DMW needed to produce Sportster or racer look-a-like machines and develop the product line, and advertise through racing achievements. He believed that the way ahead was to produce powerful multi-cylinder engines and develop the North American market. He also believed that the days of the British motorcycle were numbered unless companies could adapt to modern times. Unfortunately Leslie did not have the interpersonal or business communication skills that were necessary to raise venture capital for the new company. <br /><br />He left the company in 1948 and emigrated to Canada, where he worked for the Avro Company on the infamous Arrow jet fighter project. The Canadian Government cancelled the project in 1959, and a year later a frustrated Leslie, and his family (minus eldest son, Barry, who had joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), came home to Merseyside.Back in England, Leslie hoped to start a new motorcycle company, but this was not to be, as venture capital for a new British based motorcycle manufacturing company was just not available.  <br /><br />He died in Ellesmere Port on 6th January 1989.<br /><br />Leslie made a number of significant contributions to motorcycle deign. Some of his inventions can be seen in his following patents:<br /><br />1. The swinging arm Suspension, U.K. Patent 519,291 - 14th October 1939. To this day this is still fitted to the rear of all motorcycles.<br /><br />2. Telematic Forks, U.K. Patent 572,548 - 6th May 1943.<br /><br />3. Dual front wheel brakes, U.K. patent 587,838 - 20th January 1945. This concept eliminates the dangerous twisting forces, exerted by the single sided brakes, historically fitted to motorcycles.<br /><br />When Leslie left DMW, he sold his share of the company to Harold Nock and allowed the company to continue using his patents on the understanding that they would not be allowed to lapse, and enter the public domain. For some reason they did lapse and both Leslie and DMW potentially lost millions of pounds in patent licensing fees for the swinging arm suspension, which was universally adopted by motorcycle manufactures throughout the world. <br /><br />After Leslies departure, Mike Riley, an ex B.S.A. Development Engineer was employed as a designer, to work on the many new products. Mike was also an experienced trials rider and won the under 200c.c. award in the 1948 Scottish Trial, riding a DMW machine. Production moved to the Metal Profiles factory in Valley Road, Sedgley, because the Wolverhampton premises were too small. The lightweight road machine was soon developed. <br /><br />It was powered by a 122c.c. Villiers 10D engine. The engine, introduced in 1949, had a bore of 50mm and a 62mm stroke. There was also a built-in foot operated close ratio gearbox. It was the beginning of a long association with Villiers and its engines, which would last for over 40 years. The new machine came into production in 1950 and the company was soon producing 50 machines a week.<br /><br />The machines included a number of novel features. The 1951 models were fitted with a frame made from square section tubing and included Villiers engines and Metal Profiles front and rear suspension. There was a 122c.c. De Luxe version, which sold for 107.12s.0d and a 197c.c. De Luxe, which sold for 116. Standard versions were available for about 10 less. Metal Profiles telescopic forks sold well and were supplied to many manufacturers, including Ambassador, Dot, OEC and Sun.<br /><br />Experienced competition riders Arthur Frost and Ernie Smith joined the staff, and the new machines were entered in many competitions and racing events, in which they performed extremely well.<br /><br />DMW appeared at the Earls Court Motor Cycle Show for the first time in 1952. There were six machines displayed, three road machines and three racing machines. At the 1953 show, two new machines were added to the line-up. One of which used the new Villiers 225c.c. 1H engine, which had just been launched. It had a bore of 63mm and a stroke of 72mm, with a compression ratio of 7.5:1. The engine also had an integral foot-operated, close ratio four-speed gearbox.<br /><br /><br /><br />Information provided by Martin Tiller.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/79d934922abb562aa0325028ca5ef8fa.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6ef84df34de7f6241b2c6c9480ad7eb8.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hoehler retired from the sport at the end of the season, Max was introduced to a new passenger  Emil Hoerner  who was to remain with him until the pair retired at the end of 1966.Winning their first Grand Prix together, the German, in 1961, Max and Emil followed that with a record breaking Sidecar victory in that years TT, increasing the race record by over 3.5 mph. At the end of the season they were world champions for the first time.1962 was to be a milestone in the Sidecar TT, having set a record of 87.97 mph the previous year they went round the 37.73 mile course at 90.70 mph  the first 90+ sidecar lap!An engine problem forced their retirement of the final lap, letting Chris Vincent on his BSA twin through to win.The Germans however retained their world title for 1962.1963 brought another championship, although their luck at the TT wasnt always with them. Max and Emil crashed during practice, the resultant injuries kept Hoerner out of the chair. Barry Dungworth was a late substitute  the new crew finishing 8th.It was business as usual in 1964 and 1965 with back-to-back wins on the Snaefell Mountain Course, setting both new race and lap records each year.His last TT in 1966 was unusual in more than one way, firstly the meeting was held in August, instead of the traditional June, and secondly, although Max and Emil were originally placed 2nd just 0.8 sec. behind rivals, Scheidegger and Robinson, they were promoted to first place when the winners were excluded on a fuel technicality.Three months later on appeal Fritz Scheidegger and John Robinson were reinstated as TT winners, which also gave them the 1966 world championship.Max Deubel and Emil Hoerner both retired from the sport at the end of 66.In 1968 Max returned to his sport not as a competitor, but as an official of the governing body of the sport, the FIM.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2426202bd0e13361250279f42ed2e127.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/55e8782a16a7bbdf126296bcf9d433ab.jpg,,,,,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Did the Manx Grand Prix on a 350 Manx, built in my own time at the factory with the blessing of Joe Craig my boss. <br /><br />Finished outside the Bronze medals due to having to change a spark plug at Kirk Michael. <br /><br />Then entered as an unofficial entry at Silverstone and had water in the works.  Entered again at Thruxton, won the 350 heat and finished about 7th in the final won by Surtees. <br /><br />By this time I was testing the works racers at MIRA in the company of Ken Kavanagh and Ray Amm. <br /><br />Never mentioned in any of the Norton books, I built the first Dommie racer in the factory and raced it (number 44) at Blandford last meeting of the 1952, instructed by Joe Craig to ballast assist Eric Oliver at MIRA and found myself more or less hijacked into his sidecar for the 1953 season. Won the World Championship.<br /><br /> Raced a 500 Manx all over Europe as well as the sidecaring bit. Rejoined Norton, but fell out with Gilbert Smith, Nortons MD and left. Teamed up with Cyril Smith, the 1952 World Champion sidecar man.<br /><br />Invited to the Isle of Man in January 1954 with Eric Oliver and Cyril Smith to test ride the Clypse course.  Raced a semi works Velocette in the Barcelona 24 hour race 1956. <br /><br />Opened the roads after the Senior TT in 1957 I think it was, to get some idea of sidecar lap times prior to putting them on the big course away from the Clypse.   <br /><br />Road semi works Ariel Leader and Arrow at the Thruxton 500 mile races.  Did thousands of miles at MIRA on a 350 Manx testing Perry chains and Dunlop tyres when working for Perry. <br /><br />1965, joined NGK Spark plugs importer Les Simms who was bought out by the factory and stayed with them until 1990 when I retired.<br /><br /> I probably hold the record for the number of times visiting the Isle of Man. First as a spectator, then rider (Senior TT 1954) and passenger and I lost count of the number of times as a technical rep for both Perry and NGK.<br /><br />In 1964, was appointed personal assistant to Andrew Mustard project manager of the Donald Campbell Bluebird successful land speed record in Australia 1964.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stan Dibben - 80<br /><br />November 2005 <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />See and hear Stan on the <a href="" http://www.dukevideo.com/Bikes/DVD/Sidecars.aspx"" target=""new"">Sidecar Champions DVD</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Packed it all in after a couple of outings on a desmo Ducati in the Classic in 1981 + 1983. Moved from Manchester to spend 20 years in Cornwall where my 3 sons grew up to be surfers with no inclination to go fast on 2 wheels - Thank goodness!  Now happily divorced and been living for the last six and half years in Southern Spain, where I make a living in a variety of ways from writing to driving a JCB.

He was snapped up for the Norton works team for the 1950 TT, finishing second in the Junior and shattering the lap and race records on winning the Senior!  He took three more victories for Norton before changing to Gilera in 1953. In 1955 he won the Senior, and was declared the first rider to lap at 100mph, but this was corrected two laps later to 99.97mph. His final race was the 1959 Junior when he finished fourth on a Norton. Duke, a six-times TT winner and six-times World Champion took the sport to a whole new level with his professionalism. He was the first rider to wear revolutionary one-piece leathers, was crowned Sportsman of the Year in 1951, awarded the RAC Seagrave Trophy and, in recognition of his services to motorcycling, was awarded the O.B.E. in 1953.<br /><br />As legends and TT heroes go, they dont come much greater than Geoff Duke.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/bc0533c8ee07ef74adcf6e0d87fa8429.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d0cb7c3569873b3114222aa3359eca0e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c14991951c7ccb2da443bbc9ccef5d99.jpg,,,,6,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

The first of his record breaking 26 wins came in the 1977 Jubilee Classic Race. He won the TT Formula 1 Race six years in a row between 1983 and 1988 and was Formula 1 World Champion five times. He is the only rider to have three hat-tricks to his name - 1985 F1, Senior and Junior, 1988 F1, Senior and Junior and in 2000 the Formula One, Lightweight and Ultra Lightweight. He has lapped the course at over 110 mph in races 256 times and has more 120mph plus laps to his credit than any other rider in the history of the races. He started in 100 races on the TT course, 98 TT and two Classic MGP Junior Races. His astounding record of successes speak for themselves. Altogether Joeys 26 TT wins include 7 Formula 1, 4 Senior, 3 Junior, 5 Lightweight and 5 UltraLightweight Races, plus the 1977 Jubilee Race and the 1980 Classic 1000. During TT2000, at the age of 48, Joey counted the magnificent win in the Duke Formula One as one of his most rewarding. In his final lap of the TT circuit  the sixth lap of the Senior Race - he set his fastest ever lap at 123.87mph to become joint fourth fastest man around the course.<br /><br />Joey was killed in a racing accident in Estonia in July 2000 and the world mourned the passing of one of the greatest motorcycling legends of all time. He will be remembered for his skill and determination to win, his humility and kindness, and his warmth and sense of fun. The flash of that famous yellow helmet as he raced by is gone but the legend of Joey Dunlop will live forever.<br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c93f21ceb549042d3dabde6f5eefba2b.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/a3dfefbca3d9cb809a6ab7df852faad0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/70347a53b86a0e1ff9a993ef390e58b9.jpg,,,,26,7,7,5,7,3,4,2,3,2,3,1,1,1,0,2,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22

Oh and not forgetting 7 coveted silver replicas apiece!Perhaps the crews initial finishing place in 4th provided them with something to aim for?The German team gained their first win in the 500cc Sidecar TT of 1969, setting a new race record speed of 92.48 mph and a fastest lap at 92.54 mph in the process.1970, was to be a year of mixed fortunes, failing to complete the course in the 750cc class, after having broken the lap record at 92.37 mph, whilst retaining their 500cc laurels and lap speeds.Having won their third world championship in 1970, Enders decided to retire from the sport and try their luck on four-wheels.Twelve months later they were back on three wheels, having decided they preferred three to four wheel sport.Although they regained the world championship they relinquished in 1971, their return to the Mountain Course provided them with two non-finishes.Back on form in 1973 Klaus and Ralf completed the double, once again breaking all race and lap records.Their final TT in 1974 did not give them the send off they would have wished  a retirement.The pair however, ended the season as sidecar world champions, for the third successive year making them one of the most successful sidecar crews in the sport.It is interesting to note that they remained loyal to BMW throughout their racing careers on both three and four wheels.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c1995d8b040481fa5ab03c0d76c2b83f.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c323f1203bfc53c8c8a48a3bac37f6f7.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c68cbb4f3a7c6c94edec34be2d163ddd.jpg,,,,4,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

The engine blew on thelast lap of practice, but we got it going and it finished the race albeitwith no clutch cable and cracks in the crankcase. <br /><br />The TT was its last race  it was pretty well destroyed although it later turned up racing in Jamaica of all places! In 1972 I had a new Yamaha DS-7, entered by Barrett's of Redhill, and it ran like clockwork. All we did was put gas in it. In '73, though, it cracked the heads in practice and never ran right. I tried to make up for it by riding like an idiot but when I found out later that John 'Min'Clarke was tragically killed in the race I decided it was a warning and hung upmy leathers - at least until a couple of years ago when I dabbled in vintage racing in Canada, where I now live, for a couple of seasons.<br /><br />Currently living on Prince Edward Island, Canada - and sailing for ahobby!<br /><br />Some day, though, I'm coming back to visit the Island, the land of somany dreams...<br /><br />Photos: Number 73 is the Montesa on the mountain in '71, number 94 theYamaha I rode in the island although the photo is of a post-TT meet atSnetterton, dicing with Alan Howlett (Ducati). He beat me...<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/39e835c336909dca79df32308d426204.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/cece030441259903042e8a7f42f28101.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

In both parts he also managed to clinch a Sidecar World Championship.Fath together with passenger Alfred Wohlgemuth first competed on the Clypse Course in the Sidecar TT of 1958, retiring their BMW outfit during the 10-lap race. The following year the German pairing brought their outfit home in 4th place and collecting their first silver replicas.The Sidecar TT returned to the Mountain Course in 1960  the first time since 1925 and whilst it was expected to be a BMW benefit the speculation regarding the winning crew created the interest.The 3-lap race concluded in Helmut &amp; Alfreds favour with a winning race speed of 84.10 mph and a fastest lap of 85.79mph.By winning a further three Grands Prix of the five that counted towards the 1960 world championship they were crowned three-wheel champions.A serious accident at Nurburgring in 1961 brought an end to a promising career. Wohlgemuth was killed and Fath many months in hospital and convalescing before eventually to racing in 1967 on an outfit which he designed and constructed himself.Returning to the Isle of Man in 1967 with Wolfgang Kallaugh as passenger, like Helmuts debut in 1958, the pair retired from the race.The pair was to return in 1968 and 1969 taking 4th place in 68 and in their final outing a well-deserved 3rd podium place.Along the way Helmut and Wolfgang with the unique URS outfit took the world championship in 1968, finishing runners-up in 69.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/76b6b9d7898503e6ddf2bd8bff1d58db.jpg,,,,,,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

A clutch of fourth place finishes have followed but consistent machinery problems have prevented him from finishing higher and going quicker.<br /><br />Indeed, Martins had a frustrating time with his bikes and this had led to many road racing fans writing him off one more than one occasion. Martin knows he has the ability to win TTs and hes determined to arrive on the Island in 2008 with the machinery he needs to kick on. If he does, he will surely prove the doubters wrong.<br /><br />Supersport success may be hard to come by for the big man, but in the Superbike and Superstock classes, Finbar will always be in contention. A switch to the legendary and evocative MV Agusta for the 2007 Superstock TT showed great promise and the experience will have stood him in good stead for a greater challenge in 2008.<br /><br />Regrettably Martin lost his life in a racing incident at the 2008 Tandragee Road Races.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c736e7062ec935d48c9edc8d31ccea22.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/42a9358287403c38c91f150c0bf90cad.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/04e4cc2bcda9f9ae723472635cbc4ec7.jpg,,,,0,0,1,4,2,2,3,0,1,0,1,0,1,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8

However, those six chequered flags included 6th twice, 2nd once and 1st twice.His first victory came in the 1936 Lightweight TT riding a New Imperial setting a new race record at 74.28 mph. Bobs second win came in the Junior Race of the first meeting after the end of the war, bringing a Velocette home at an average of 80.31 mph in what was deemed a Velocette white wash as the marque took the first four places.Away from the TT, A R Foster competed in the World Championships in 1949 and 1950 on Velos, taking runner up position in the first year and going one better in the latter. He retired from the world stage after taking the title, to concentrate on his motor business in Dorset, although he rode one last time in the Island in 51 gaining a sixth place in the Junior TT on his faithful Velo.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2c599cd77d9696a5e864cc1edc98e3b9.jpg,,,,,,2,1,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11

The Senior saw him take 38th place.1955 saw a reversal of roles, finishing 13th in the Junior and retiring in the Senior with a broken gear lever.1956 and Frank had three entries, Lightweight 125 and 250, plus the Senior.Both Lightweight races were run on the Clypse Course although he was forced to retire from both races with mechanical trouble on the MV Agusta machines he was riding. The Senior did bring him a 16th place again him yet another silver replica.Golden Jubilee Year, 1957 brought the Yorkshireman his best results. Riding for one of the sports major sponsors, Reg Dearden and having built the two machines from spare parts, he finished 15th in the seven lap Junior and 12th in the 'blue-riband' Senior TT, run over an extended eight laps.By now a 'professional racer' a change of direction took place in 1958 moving from solo machines to sidecars, both as a driver and passenger!For that years TT he was passenger to Bill Beevers- they failed to finish the race.Retiring from racing in early 1959, due mainly to the spiraling costs, he was back racing on the Mountain Course in the 1960 Senior, finishing 30th on a brand new Norton loaned to him especially for the TT, gaining his last silver replica.Frank has lived and still lives on the Isle of Man in retirement.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/28704038ca0941efd9256da206a342d2.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

He won the 1935 Junior Manx Grand Prix and then joined the Norton team for the 1936 TT Races. It was a winning combination as Frith took the Junior and finished second in the Senior. In 1937 he went one better in the Senior and took a brilliant win. He also set the first 90mph plus lap of the course. After finishing third in the 1939 Senior he missed the 1947 TT due to a practice spill on a 500cc Moto Guzzi. Turning to Velocettes in 1948 he won the Junior Race, repeating this success a year later. Frith also has the distinction of being the first ever 350cc World Champion.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/8e472cd34dc001d06b55f03b778cca9e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/5276306560369c0ab26f00f22071a784.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7f85213a6c23862aac06350f7c426f97.jpg,,,,4,1,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,3

After attending school in Switzerland and Canada, I received a Certificate in Photography from the renowned Banff School of Fine Arts in 1974, and graduated from the University of Calgary in 1980. I currently hold an AMA (American Motorcyclist Association) Expert-level road-racing license. <br /><br />My book, Classic Motorcycles (Michael Friedman Publishing Group, New York) has sold over 15,000 copies in hardcover. It focuses on the social, political, and cultural history of the motorcycle. My articles about motorcycles and motorcycle racing have been published in Advertising Age, Canadian Business, American Motorcyclist, Performance Bikes, and Classic Bike, among others. 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Racing' was nominated for a Canadian Magazine Award. I have also published numerous articles on the subjects ranging from fishing to celebrity profiles. I have been a ghost-writer for senior executives on the subject of marketing strategy, and ghost-wrote a memoir of life in the Canadian arctic. <br /><br />When not writing about or racing motorcycles, I am an advertising agency creative director. <br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He came to fame when he won the 1969 Lightweight Manx Grand Prix in a time of 1.39.55.6 and a speed of 90.63. He had a glittering career both at the TT and on the GP circuits when he raced in the World Championships notably in the famous Gold Hermetite colours. He was tenth in the 500 class in 1973 but his best year was in 1975 when he finished in seventh place in the 500cc Grand Prix world championship. He finished on the podium (in third place) at the 1975 500cc Czech GP, the 1975 350cc Dutch TT and the 1977 500cc Austrian GP, and had a number of other top six results in the 500, 350 and 250cc GP classes, in those days riders did more than one race a day, they had to earn their money. He also raced in the F750 World Championship and I certainly remember a great weekend at Zolder in Belgium spent with friends and a bottle of Asbach 5 star brandy when he was battling with the likes of the Australian Jack Findlay.  Alex also won three TT races of which his greatest win must be in 1979 when he beat Mike Hailwood by a mere 3.4 seconds after 6 hard fought laps around the famous Mountain Course. However he showed us all what a week it was going to be by starting out in the Formula 1 race with nothing less than a win and top step of the podium, he obviously developed a taste for the champagne! He is still very modest about beating Mike the Bike in what was a really first class race. His first win came in in the 1975 Production race when he rode the legendary Triumph Slippery Sam to victory with another legend, Dave ""Crasher"" Croxford, a hard race and a total of 10 laps distance, the race started with a Le Mans type start for the 3 classes, each group going in a separate start but Alex once told me that the bottom of Bray Hill was no place for the faint hearted with it being like a short circuit start and more than 30 bikes after the same bit of tarmac. He had his lows as well, I remember well the time when he crashed at the Ginger Hall pub, I think in 1977 when he rode for Honda receiving serious injuries. He was also part of Honda's black protest at 1981 TT when Honda protested against Suzuki. His career effectively came to an end with another crash in the 1982 TT, although he did return to take part in the 1992 Senior Classic Manx Grand Prix where he finished in a creditable 11th place on a 500 Manx Norton.  In 2009 he featured on the special 50th Honda anniversary stamp issue in the Isle of Man when he appeared on the stamp representing the 70s.  But every story has a beginning and for Alex it began by building a 200cc Tiger Cub in the workshop at his dad's motorcycle shop in Glasgow. A lot of hours were spent working after school to help raise money for his efforts on the race track and he made that first appearance shortly after his 14th birthday in March or April 1963 at Gask, near Perth, he can't remember the exact date but does remember that he was under age at the time. But no records were set that day nor were any signs shown of the true potential that was going to surface in the future, Alex finished last out of 40 starters! More hours were spent working to raise the princely sum of 4 17/6d old money for a high compression piston to get a bit more speed out of that bike. He started on a real shoestring, wearing a two piece PVC riding suit and of course a pudding basin crash helmet. As he put it when I asked if he had any photos of that day..........""Photos, hey man I could only just afford a gallon of 101 to use in the bike, no cameras, no food, no style, a bike made from bits........but the will to win was ignited that day!!!"" And no doubt that steely eyed look that we have all come to know was there as well waiting to put fear into his opponents if not at that first meeting then shortly after. If ever a rider has shown determination it has to be this guy.  Alex set up Red Rocket Racing at Snetterton race Circuit when he finished riding at the top level and many of us who were racing soon found someone who would willingly pass on valuable advice learnt from his own time in the sport, not just someone who took your money and left you to it. Mind you at one very wet meeting at West Raynham he stopped me as I was heading out for the grid and taped up the inside on my visor to prevent steaming up.......as I was leaving after the meeting he called out to tell me I had to pay for a roll of gaffa tape as it was now secondhand, but I only paid a secondhand price for it because it had already been used!! Ever the Scot looking after the pennies!!!",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/fa45d7390c06202c9e87caaa0f1daac6.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/a7c40aa64fd1da370f059551f01278e9.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/4a608a829472a34ce90a12d21b3ffc24.jpg,,,,3,1,2,3,4,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,21

The only tune up it got was when the cork clutch burned out, was replaced with Ferodo inserts. Fuel used then was benzene from the Dry-Salters in Kilmarnock<b>1946 350cc AJS standard road bike</b>, had some success at trials, no luck at Turnberry, did win a knockout hill-climb at Old Cumnock in 1952.<br /><br /><b>Willies 1952 350cc BSA Gold Star semi road racing and get to work bike</b>. <br /><br />       Was first sponsored by the previous owner of this bike Joe Kelly of Troon. Had my first success with his machine when finishing third in my class at Crail Aerodrome in 1953. Bought the Gold Star of Joe the same year, and went on to win nearly all experts barred races I was allowed to enter. Except Kinnel Aerodrome, where, I got a puncture in the rear tyre on the last lap while racing in the 350cc final, just managed to scrape into 2nd place. Won my 500cc heat, finished 1st in the final. The same day I finished second to Bob McIntyre in the 350 open class, and 4th in the 500cc class.<br /><br /><b>September 1953</b>. Tried my first big race, <b>The Carrowdore 100</b> in Ireland. By this time the Goldie had done a lot of racing miles, and I had never done anything to the engine. In fact, I dont think its been touched since it was first rode by Bob McIntyre in the 1952 Junior Clubmans on the Isle of Man, where he finished 2nd and broke the lap record. <br /><br /> In the Carrowdore race that day, I was on my third lap when the engine started cutting out at<b> 6,500rpm</b>, its supposed to do <b>7,000rpm</b>  I pulled into the pits to tell my mechanic, Bobby Mason a work mate who was with me on this trip. told him Id better stop now to save what life was left in the engine to get us home, he agreed with me.<br /><br />I had made friends with Jimmy Morton of Killochhead farm, since being introduced to him at the Prestwick sand racing back in 1950. He knew more than I did about where to send for spare parts, so during the winter of 1953 I left the Goldie at Jimmys place, where I worked with him in my spare time. He rebuilt the bike with the new and reconditioned parts as they came back from the suppliers.<br /><br />Jimmy had said he fancied doing the 1954 350cc Junior Clubmans on the Isle of Man, and would I like to have a go, I sure would, knowing I was going to have him with me. The last part of the Gold Stars engine, which took six month to come back, arrived on the Friday, the cylinder barrel. Giving us two days to get the bike finished, were scheduled to catch the boat for the Isle of Man Sunday afternoon. The bike was completed on the Saturday, started running in the engine travelling to Sorn Village, then Muirkirk, Strathhaven, Darvel, Galston, and back to the farm after doing four laps. Sunday we left to travel down to Fleetwood, where we got the boat for the Isle of Man. <br /><br />Was still running the engine in on the way down to Fleetwood, and putting in some more miles learning the coarse on the Isle of Man.<br /><br />To cut a long story short, I raced in the Junior Clubmans, finished 8th, was my greatest achievement to beat Bob McIntyres times, my average speed<b> 80.5mph</b>, my fastest lap<b> 81.9mph</b>, was one mile per hour faster than my Idol <b>Robert MacGregor McIntyre</b>.<br /><br />While still in the Island that week, was watching the sidecar racing on the Clypse circuit, had parked the Goldie about 3 hundred yards back on the road beside a thousand other bikes. When the racing was finished, went back to collect my bike, it wasnt there, couldnt find it anywhere. I thought the boys who were with me had hidden it for a joke, I just could not believe it had been stolen.<br /><br />            The bike was found two days later behind a wall in a field, minus the cylinder barrel that I waited six months for, plus the cylinder head and carburettor. Theres another story here, but wont have the space on this page to print it. Arriving back home with what was left of the bike on Monday. Cooper Bro.s uplifted the bike for me at Ardrossan. On Tuesday took what was left of the engine down to the BSA factory, where they had been invited to a dinner and dance for their agents to celebrate BSA Companys success on the Isle of Man. <br /><br />Had the engine back in three days Friday, 1 oclock Saturday morning had the bike ready, left Troon 7am Saturday morning riding my bike, accompanied by Joe Kelly and his wife on their Norton Dominator, heading for Kirkcaldy Beverage Park. I was entered in both 350 and 500cc races, I didnt finish the 350 class because of carburettor problems, finished second to Bob McIntyre, who was on his 500cc G45 Matchless in the 500cc heat.<br /><br />The Gold Star was going much better by the time I arrived back in Ireland to race the 1954 Carrowdore 100. Rode the bike there again with my work mate Bobby Mason riding pillion and Jerry Borland another work mate riding his 350cc AJS.I won the Handicap race and finished 2nd in the scratch.<br /><br />Sold the Gold Star later that year, bought one of Sam Coopers 7R AJSs, cause he was giving up the racing. When I found transport to up lift the 7R from Coopers of Troon, was about to take it away, when Sam came over and asked me how would I like to race the Northwest 200. Sam I would love to have a go at the Northwest but I cant afford to take a bike over there, never mind a van. Dont you worry, Ill see to that, Ive got a couple of entries for it. <br /><br />So that was it, after me buying the 7R from him hes decided to sponsor me, no more worries about getting to and from race meeting now. Which I very much appreciated, no more having to ride the bike to the tracks, and no worries about getting back home. Was still allowed to enter the experts barred races, which I won easy with the 7R.<br /><br />Coopers entered me for the 1955 Northwest 200 in Ireland, my first international race, had the fastest lap in practise, which gave me pole position. Made an ass of the start by stalling the engine, got going again and fought my way back into first place. Which I held for a lap and a haft, Jackie Woods on a Geoff Duke BSA Gold Star passed me and went on to win the race, I held onto 2nd place till the last lap but one, when my engine seized up. Sams younger brother Leslie was in the race also, he crashed about the third or fourth lap, lost a leg. We had picked up a dose of doctored petrol that day at one of the garages in Ireland. Leslies 7R when the engine was stripped had started to burn up the same way as mine had done.<br /><br />Entered for the 1955 Scottish Championships held at Beverage Park Kirkcaldy, finished 2nd in my first heat of the 350cc class, after getting away first at the start, then the plug lead jumping off. Won my semi final, finished 2nd to McIntyre in the 350 final. Was first in the 500cc heat. First in my semi final, and 2nd again to McIntyre in the final still using my 350cc 7R AJS. The lap records for Kirkcaldy races were broken six times that day. <br /><br />Sam Cooper bought a 500cc Manx Norton, which I used at Errol Aerodrome Perth for the first time, broke the 500cc lap record with it, McIntyre wasnt there to stop me winning the races I entered. Sam entered me for the 1955 Manx Grand Prix on the Isle of Man, and had bought another Manx Norton, the 350cc model, I was to ride both Nortons, Sandy Bowie was to use my 350 7R. The rev counter on the 350 Norton wasnt working that first practise morning, didnt notice it till Id started on my first lap, I decided to carry on and judge the revs from the noise of the engine. This was the moment Id been waiting for, to ride a featherbed Norton round the TT coarse. I got 32 miles round the coarse was really enjoying myself, when reaching Brandywell corner a left hander, my left footrest hit the road and through me up straight, the last thing I saw was the shadow of palings coming at me and the front wheel was in a tank-slapper. I was six weeks in Nobles hospital on the island, before they let me go home with a paralysed left arm. <br /><br /><b>Enjoy your racing while you can. <i>Willie Gibson</i></b><br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Information kindly provided by John Gibson.</i><br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/9034bc9041c01ee55fb422361f3b7609.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/78675d4b5005c506a32bbc6aa430d5b6.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/70f0b9e9a04aa1b853d2a44c3ca3617c.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was an inauspicious beginning, Graham managed 12th on an OK Supreme in his first year and suffered a retirement two years later in the 1939 Lightweight Race. After the war Graham returned in 1947 on the revolutionary A.J.S. Porcupine. Two years later he came close to winning the 1949 Senior before having to push in from Cronk-ny-Mona to take 10th place. He did however become the first 500cc World Champion that year. He then changed to MV Agustas and took second place in the 1952 Senior. His only win came in the 1953 Ultra-Lightweight Race; tragically he lost his life just a few days later in the Senior Race, in an accident at the bottom of Bray Hill on  lap two. Grahams TT appearances and successes epitomised his unique skills on a motorcycle and many who watched him race feel privileged to have done so.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2b819671cc3c2d2768788ada14b37851.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/f951e0250e8750e18ad99420462e8dd1.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/28dff4981af2033352a35b79f5a4fa09.jpg,,,,1,1,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8

Grant rewrote the record books in 1975 when he smashed Mike Hailwoods eight year old lap record. He waited until the second lap of the final race of the week - the six lap Classic - and blitzed round at 109.82mph. The race ended in retirement for Grant but there was consolation in the new lap record and his win earlier in the week in the Senior Race. Altogether Grant won two Seniors, two Classics and one TT Formula 1 before notching up his final win - the 1985 Production 750cc race.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c488c7dfa6a0a214b0010ada39d3a9e0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/f6f5e051923f65733d359ea2ba8c658a.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b6a8648092a80f35d3f9f3940a626040.jpg,,,,7,6,3,0,1,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,22

7077,Geoffrey J Greenham,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=7077&filter=G,N,"Motorbikes are Geoffs passion. He began racing motorbikes at the age of 16 in 1973. He then stopped racing in 1986 after a bad accident, which destroyed his bike beyond repair. But luckily Geoff was not badly injured. He managed to get away with a broken collarbone and a bump on the back of his head where the bike hit him.<br /><br />Geoff Greenham has gained more and more experience over the years and is now one of the best engine/chassis builders in England. He has also participated in helping to build the ultimate street bike. But this was not enough for him. Two years later he started working on Grand Prix Bikes.<br /><br />A year later, in 1992 while still supplying parts to racers he began working on British Super bikes for that year only. In 1999 Geoff began to supply specialist parts for certain road bikes. He has continued to branch out in this field of motorbikes. But Geoff Greenham Racing ran into bit of a problem in 2001.<br /><br />In 2001 Yamaha stopped producing some parts. This caused a problem when customers called and enquired about them. So later that year Geoff decided that they would have to get them commissioned. He drew detailed diagrams (including exact measurements) of the parts they needed and sent them to certain people in the UK, America but most of them went to a company in Spain.<br /><br />Geoff Greenham Racing is now one of the only companies in the world, which supply these parts. Every year Geoff is getting in more and more customers. He makes sure that every customer goes home happy. Because they are happy with his services and his quality of work they always recommend him. In the future Geoff hopes to branch out more into road/street bikes.<br /><br />Geoffrey John Greenham and his wife Dawn Helen Greenham established the company in 1986. They have a good reputation and are always well recommended. They started up the company mainly selling used TZ spares but branched out into new TZ spares.<br /><br />By Emma Greenham<br /><br /><br /><br />Link: <a href="" http://www.greenhamracing.supanet.com/"" target=""new""> www.greenhamracing.supanet.com/</a>.<br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He competed in the Junior but retired. His first victory came seven years later in the 1930 Lightweight Race on an A.J.S. Guthrie was a Norton works rider from 1931 to 1937 and completed a Junior/Senior double in 1934. In 1937 he took a popular win in the Junior, but his Senior Race ended at the Cutting with a retirement. Later on that same year Guthrie was killed while competing in the German Grand Prix. A Memorial was built at the point on the climb up the Mountain where he retired in his last TT Race.

Three on the Mountain Course and once on the newly introduced Clypse Course in the latter year.Analysis of his results will show one retirement; two runner-up places and one win.Little known outside Germany before 1952, Werners arrival in the Isle of Man as part of the works NSU team with the experienced Bill Lomas as teammate.All went well during practice, until the final session, when Lomas fell at Sulby Bridge putting out of that years TT.However, Haas did not disappoint in his debut year, finishing 41 seconds behind MV teamster Les Graham and finishing two seconds ahead of Cecil Sandford, Grahams teammate.In the Lightweight Race, the German went into the lead in the massed start race, the NSU twin easily outpacing the single cylinder Guzzi of Fergus Anderson. By Ramsey the wily Scot was in the lead and with, mist on the Mountain used his course knowledge to eventually lead the NSU rider home by some 17 seconds. In turn Werner was over four minutes ahead of Siegfried Wuensche on the DKW.If 1953 had been a fine baptism to the Mountain Course, 1954 was to prove the Germans ability as a master of the Mountain taking victory in the Lightweight 250 TT by 44.2 seconds from Ruppert Hollaus, with Reg Armstrong third  both of whom were his team-mates!His luck was to change in the Ultra Lightweight race, being held on the 10.79 mile Clypse Course for the first time as he was forced to retire during the race with mechanical trouble.Werner Haas retired at the end of the 1954 season after NSU announced their withdrawal from Grand Prix racing.Having won the 125 and 250 world titles in 1953, he retained the 250 crown in 1954.Taking up flying as an interest, he sadly lost his life in an accident in November 1956.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/f72c535ada063a31f4560fb26aa24726.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/cab2265157031b58f9a05fa6a6ce095c.jpg,,,,,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

His fans worshipped him and he repaid them with an 18-year career which was nothing short of  awe-inspiring. During his incredible reign Mike-the-Bike scored no less than 14 TT victories and 9 World Championship titles. He was a natural rider and possessed a steely determination which was no better illustrated than in the 1965 Senior. He crashed at Sarahs Cottage and amazingly restarted the engine. With a broken screen, and flattened exhaust megaphones - not  to mention a bloody nose - he ran in for a pit stop to straighten  his bent handlebars and then roared off to win the race. He was a fighter and the fans loved him for it. He first rode in 1958, winning four replicas. He gave Honda their first TT wins in 1961 with a Lightweight double and added the Senior on a Norton for the first TT hat-trick. In 1962 he won 4 races with MV Agusta before returning to Honda in 1966, winning the Lightweight and Senior. After winning the Junior, Lightweight and Senior in 1967 - his second hat-trick - he retired and turned to cars. Two of his most amazing TT victories were made during his comeback in 1978. After 11 years in retirement Hailwood crossed the finishing line on a Ducati victorious in the Formula One and in 1979 returned once more to win his last ever TT, the Senior Race.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/4693ad462ca4883a1cee24187cfddc98.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2c7f48487d26d50bd9d5ff05438c25fe.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/76bcecbb792dceb1bd1bd3e40f4f8811.jpg,,,,14,1,4,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

There were many models of all makes, and ranged from early twenties onwards; carbide lights, rim brakes etc.<br /><br />Had a go at Trials and Scrambling, but found that Track Racing was lessstrenuous, thus, mark you, and relatively so, on ""bed ends"" on wheels.<br /><br />My two pals mooted a go at the Clubmans and, somewhat loathed, I, with the greatest of reservations, agreed to accompany them.    Backed up by that superb business of hire purchase, we entered for the 1953 Junior event, and enjoyed a huge measure of non-success.<br /><br />Things were to improve in the following years and this led on to theblessedness of sponsorship.   Much could be written about our trials regarding the raising of cash prior to sponsorship. Nothing illegal, ofcourse.<br /><br />There is an achievement that may not have been bettered by any other rider and that being the fact that, only on one occasion, I entered a slip road and this having competed in 15 TT events covering Clubmans, MGPs and TTs. Not even when I did my stints at travelling marshall!<br /><br />My present mount is a 'Pegaso' and I have had this for six years. Armchair comfort with fantastic handling.<br /><br />My small motorcycle business keeps me out of my dear wife's hair, and the only other interest of any great demand is Greenock Wanderers' Rugby Club.<br /><br />Reminiscing does bring some embarrassment. To my sadly deceased sponsors, Messrs. Tyson, Robertson and Dearden, I owed a great deal.   I had an absolutely marvellous time and my thanks also goes to those who made competitions possible.<br /><br />One final point, asked as I often have been if I ever won an I.O.M. race, I am happy to reply with the excuses of Bob McIntyre, Geoff Duke, John Surtees, Mike Hailwood and a host of other stars of that GoldenEra........ but I did try!!<br /><br /><br /><br />Ewen Haldane, Greenock<br /><br />January 2004<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/3a7e21d2903231933dd70ae1452da58c.jpg,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The bikes were ridden for fun , down on a farm near to his village of Bishops Sutton. Around this period his parents moved to Southampton and Len was instructed by his father to dispose of his bikes by buying them in a field!! As far as he knows they are lying there to this day.<br /><br />From the age of 14 he worked in the forge and machine shop of a local engineering works earning just two shillings and six pence (12.5p) per week. Although the pay was low, the experience gained was priceless and was to lead, in years to come, to the ultimate satisfaction of building and racing his own machine in the world famous TT Races. However, before this came the second world war. Len, like most young men of this era enlisted into the army and served his country until 1946. <br /><br />It was during this period, whilst stationed in the Middle East that he took part in his first competitive motorcycle event, The Inter Divisional Scrambles, the bug had bitten!!<br /><br />On leaving the army Len continued his engineering career and also joined the Southampton Motorcycle Club. He took part in trials, grass track and scramble events, using the same bike but changing the barrels, pistons and cylinder heads depending on which event he was competing in. This he continued to do until 1950, then, as he says "" I drifted into the road race scene"". Racing the same bike he continued to compete in grass track and scrambles until the end of 1952. ""I also took part in the first ever road race meeting at Brands Hatch"" he recalled.<br /><br />The commencement of his love affair with Monas Isle started when he went to spectate at the first TT after the war in 1947, being particularly impressed with Bob Fosters win in the Junior. This initial visit wasnt without incident, falling foul of the Island Constabulary!! Len recalls"" I only had the one bike which I competed and rode to work on, so it was natural that I took this to the Island. It had a fishtail exhaust pipe but no silencer and a lovely throaty roar, well at least I thought so!! However, the local Police didnt quite agree with me. Whilst riding through Douglas I was summoned to stop and given a caution and told to go quietly, which of course I duly did ?""  <br /><br />Len carried on gaining road race experience and in 1953 he entered the TT for the first time. ""The bike was a rather special 125cc BSA Bantam that had a piston on the side of the engine which did the induction, operating much the same as a disc valve."" Unfortunately it was an inauspicious start to TT racing with the bike having a tendency to seize. During practice a rear rod spindle broke as he was going through Quarry Bends and although the bike could have been repaired it was the end of  Lens first TT. The owner of the machine decided that the stresses and strains of the Mountain Course was too much for the little bike and he withdrew his entry. This was to be Lens first and only competitive venture on the Mountain Course, the follow year the Lightweight 125cc TT was run over the shorter 10.79 mile Clypse Course.<br /><br />Undeterred by his misfortune he planned to return  to the TT in 1954 and to make a return with a difference! Len takes up the story ""In those days, as today, the buying and maintenance of a racing bike was an expensive business and one I could ill afford. I had harboured ambitions to design and build my own machine for sometime and the motivation came from a conversation with a friend just after the 1953 TT. He told me that it was a pipe dream and I would never be able to do it, well that was like holding a red rag to a bull and the rest is history as they say.""<br /><br />The hard work was now to begin, with the bike being started from scratch, everything from the design, the making of the tools and the sourcing of  the materials. Len made a wooden pattern of the engine, a frame jig and a cam grinder, all of which, along with the original drawings, he still has today. The materials were obtained from an aircraft manufacturer and the engine castings were made for nothing by a friend who owned the local foundry. The frame was made on his home made jig and so the first 125cc LCH was built. The design was that of an over square engine that revved to 10,000rpm. The bike was entered for the 1954 Lightweight 125cc TT. The fulfilment of a dream was near, Len carries on the tale ""testing went well but I thought the crank pin was not strong enough to race on the Island and a local bearing manufacturer offered to make me one which I gratefully accepted. I gave the manufacturer the specifications and the crank pin was duly made and fitted into the engine. I went down to the local aerodrome to run it in, but within three minutes disaster struck! The pin broke and wrecked the engine, my dream of racing my own bike on the Island was gone for at least another year. The bearing manufacturer accepted full responsibility but it was little consolation. I was still determined to race in the TT and I borrowed a BSA Bantam and I made my way to the Island.""<br /><br />""I hadnt been on the Island very long when I bumped into Dr Joe Ehlich who asked me to ride one of his works EMCs, this was an offer I just couldnt refuse. I joined Harvey Williams, F.H.Burman, H.L.Fruin in the four man team. Practice went well until the last session when Harvey unfortunately crashed at the second of the Morney bends, breaking his thigh.""<br /><br />After the problems with his own bike and then procuring a works machine, Len could well have hoped for a good finish in the race. However, there was to be no fairy tale ending, ""Dr Joe instructed my mechanic to drain the gearbox and refill it with two different oils at a ratio of four parts to one. This he did but to less than half full resulting in me seizing and sliding into the bank at the Nook on lap 1, nether me or the bike were seriously damaged but it was the end of my race! Austrian Rupert Hollaus won on an NSU in 1hr 33 mins 07.4 secs at an average speed of 69.57mph. My team mates H.L.Fruin and F.H.Burman both retired on laps 9 and 5 respectively."" Len carried on racing the EMC on the British short circuits for the rest of the season.<br /><br />The change to the Clypse Course was controversial at the time with many believing that it would deprive the riders of the traditional prestige gained over the Mountain Course, however, Len particularly liked the course. ""I suppose I was one of the scratches of the day and the Clypse Course complimented my riding style. The section from Creg-ny-Baa to Onchan was my favourite part, and of course the massed start made Parkfield Corner interesting on the first lap. Yes, I enjoyed the course very much.""<br /><br />The desire to race his own machine was as great as ever and by the start of the 1955 season the LCH had been modified and rebuilt, Len again entered the 125cc Lightweight TT. The lure of the Isle of Man beckoned and Len set off from Southampton confident that this would finally be his year for a good result. A satisfactory practice period reinforced this belief. In a race dominated by the Italian works teams of MV and Mondial, Len progressed steadily. At the end of the second lap he was on the leader board in 12th position, moving up to 9th by the fifth lap and then to 8th on the eighth lap. After nine hard laps, in a race won by Carlo Ubbiali in 1hr 23 mins 38.2 secs averaging 69.67mph, Len came home eighth. ""Being the first private entrant on a British bike home following five works MVs, a Mondial and an EMC Puch was very satisfying. However having built the bike, this gave me the greatest pride and pleasure,"" said Len.  <br /><br />Never one to rest on his laurels, Len continued to develop and modify his engine. The availability of Hepolite pistons (made for MV) enabled him to increase the power band to 12,000 revs with a bore and stoke ratio of 53:56.<br /><br />The 1956 TT proved to be one of the most frustrating for Len and one that clearly rankles him today. Len continues ""The conditions at the start were very poor and I thought caution was the better part of valour, so I started slowly and gradually picked up speed as conditions improved. There was a high retirement rate with only about 12 bikes racing by the seventh lap. I was a few seconds behind Frank Cope and could see that I was catching him. At the end of lap eight the start line officials let Frank go through to start his final lap but flagged me off !! They said that time had run out but this wasnt so. I would have had time to do two laps and not just the one that I had left to do. In those days you didnt protest too much, but I did let my feeling be known."" Len certainly didnt suffer fools gladly and it is a characteristic that many have   tested and regretted. ""Frank finished ninth and last of the twenty starters and I still believe I could have caught him given the chance !""  The race was again won by Carlo Ubbiali in a time of 1hr 24 mins 16.8 secs at a speed of 69.13mph. He lapped all but second place finisher, Marcella Cama, whom he beat by over five minutes.<br /><br />Not to be put off by officialdom, Len returned again in 1957 to race in the 125cc Lightweight TT. Practice went without incident but unfortunately he couldnt say the same about the race. Shortly before the start of the race there had been a light shower which had dampened the roads. A strong north-westerly wind had all but dried the track but it was the wind that was to cause Len some difficulties. The climb from Hillberry to Creg-ny-Baa was particularly gruelling and on the third lap the wind caught the dustbin fairing and blew Len across the road. This happened twice as he passed gateways in the hedgerow and he elected to stop at the end of the lap to remove the fairing. It was whilst he was in the pits that he noticed a broken valve spring and that was the end of his race. Tarquino Provini winning in 1hr 27mins 51 secs at a speed of 73.69mph. <br /><br />1958 proved to be an uneventful year, again riding in only the 125cc Lightweight TT. Practice went without incident and in the race Len finished a creditable sixteenth, having gone faster than he had ever done before. The race was again dominated by Italian machinery taking eight of the top ten positions, MZ claiming the other two. A young Mike Hailwood finished seventh on a Paton and the race was won by Carlo Ubbiali in 1hr 24 mins 12.0 secs at an average speed of 72.86mph.<br /><br />1959 was to prove to be Lens last competitive appearance in the TT but by no means his last visit to the Island. Again he entered his 125cc LCH in the Lightweight race, in a year that saw the introduction of the Japanese manufacturer Honda. As in the previous year, he had a successful TT finishing 16th out of thirty five starters. The race was won by Tarquino Provini in 1hr 27 mins 25.2 secs at a record speed of 74.06mph, foreign manufacturers filling the top ten finishers. <br /><br />Following a heavy fall at Mallory Park Len decided to retire at the end of the 1959 season. Len recalled the incident that led to this decision, ""In those days there was gorse bushes all round the lake at Gerrards so you couldnt see all the way around the bend. As I entered the corner I saw another rider crossing the track so I tried to take avoiding action. The only way to do this was to lay the bike down, which I did, but unfortunately I thumped into the bank and knocked myself about quite a bit. I sold the bike, an NSU, to George Collis, and called it a day.""<br /><br />As it happens it wasnt the end of Lens racing career but after seven very eventful years it was the end of racing on the Isle of Man. Lens commitment and involvement in the TT wasnt to end but thats another story.......<br /><br /><br /><br />I revisited Len in January 1995 and as usual he was not at home with his feet up, but down at his workshop. He was engineering titanium valve spring retainers to reduce the weight of his 250cc NSU. Approaching his 75th birthday, his commitment to precision engineering and his enthusiasm for motorcycle racing puts most to shame. ""At the moment I am working on a trick engine for my NSU. It will not be finished until next year and I hope to ride it in the Classic Parade. Ive also ordered a Corollo con-rod from the USA and I am replacing other parts with titanium. The aim is to improve performance by reducing the reciprocating weight of the motor,"" Len said.<br /><br />Lens premature retirement from motorcycle racing came after a big get off at Mallory Park near the end of the 1959 season. ""Following the crash I decided enough was enough and immediately sold my bike to George Collis. I suppose, in retrospect, it was a hasty decision. However, I had been planning to start my own business for sometime and without any racing commitments I could give my new venture my full attention. My garage, Len Harfield Ltd.,  opened in early 1960 for the sale of petrol and car repair maintenance."" The business was a team effort with Len working in the garage during the day and his wife, Winifred, manning the petrol pumps during the evening. <br /><br />Although his commitment to business was total, the urge to go motorcycle racing again could not be quelled and in January 1961 Len purchased another 250cc NSU. He spent the next few months making it ready to race, however, after a couple of short circuit outings he was convinced it would not be competitive. The TT was never an option in his racing comeback, solely due to the time constraints of being unable to leave the business for two weeks at a time. He did, however, take short trips to the Island to watch the races each year.<br /><br />Len continues his story:  ""The NSU appeared to be past its sell by date, so during the winter of 1961 I purchased a 250cc Honda CB72 engine and manufactured the frame and forks for it. Later in 1962 I bought a 305cc Honda CB77 engine and bored this out to 350cc, again using my own frame and forks. I raced these machines with modifications until I finally retired from racing in 1974."" Len is not a person to look back and reflect on what might have been, but he did concede: ""in my early days I was too dedicated to the 125cc class, the bike was difficult to ride and you really had to tie yourself in knots to get the best out of it. I couldnt believe how easy the 250 was to ride and the 350?, well that was even easier. They would have been great to ride on the Mountain Course.""<br /><br />During the late 1960s Len started to become involved in scrutineering at various meetings. This included being the Specification Scrutineer for the Endurance 500 miler at Thruxton and later Chief Scrutineer for endurance racing at Donnington Park. In 1969 Len produced the specifications for the Production Races and the following year he was asked to become the Chief Scrutineer for the TT Races. He held this position for eleven years, up until and including the 1980 TT Races. Len takes up the story: ""when I took over the scrutineering facilities were very basic to say the least! We had a little tent just by the Glencrutchery Road and the bikes were wheeled in to be checked. <br /><br />The lack of space meant that we bumped into each other every time we moved, also the bikes were ground level and could not be viewed properly. It really was a chaotic and shambolic arrangement. At the back of the Grandstand I found some ramps that had been left over from the International Six day Trials and after talking to Ken Shierson I brought them into the scrutineering tent. The ramps made a world of difference, firstly the bikes entered in an orderly  manner and secondly the scrutineering became more efficient with the detection of faults being made easier. One evening during practice we discovered seven cracked frames, all of which were around the steering head. The detection of which, I believe, was made because of our greater visibility.""     <br /><br />     As well as being Chief Scrutineer Len was also a member of the organising committee and was instrumental in abandoning the overnight Weigh-In"" before races and also morning practices for the 1978 TT. Len explained: ""the overnight weigh-in meant that bikes were impounded and leant against wooded stakes in a marquee, protected by security guards. It wasnt unusual for the stakes to fall over during the night, especially when it had rained, and for the bikes to sustain some minor damage. The riders preparation time was also restricted, leaving no time for last minute adjustments. We also impounded the riders helmets, these were hung up in a shed which unfortunately had a leaking roof giving some riders a damp start to their race!!<br /><br />I suggested the abandonment of morning practice after the 1977 TT, which was poorly attended that year. We tried this in 1978 but the experiment only lasted the one year because too may riders complained of not having enough practice time.""<br /><br />To all intents and purposes Len enjoyed his time as Chief Scrutineer, however, there was one aspect that he neither enjoyed or got used to and that was attending the Coroners Court for inquests on fatal accidents. Understandably, this is something he doesnt dwell on. During his career he believes he had the riders respect, not that they always agreed with his diagnosis or decision. On more than one occasion he had to disappoint riders  by withdrawing their bike because they were unsafe. One anecdote Len recalls was that of Tony Godfrey having to be lifted off his bike because the petrol tank had split resulting in burns to the top of his legs and worse. The eyes water just thinking about it!!<br /><br />Lens team consisted of 22 scrutineers, all volunteers from the mainland, receiving no expenses or salary. Len and his deputy, Bob Payton, did receive travel and accommodation expenses. Bob, a close friend, still accompanies  Len on their annual pilgrimage to the Island. They both relinquished their roles after the 1980 TT races, mainly due to the internal politics of the organising committee of that era.<br /><br />As stated earlier, Len did not suffer fools gladly. Vernon Cooper wrote to Len to ask him to reconsider but the enjoyment had been soured. He could see no real change in the foreseeable future and stepped down. That was not the end of his participation in the TT Races because he participated in the 1986 Classic parade and has done so every year 1988. ""I really  enjoy the Classic Lap, although I would prefer two laps rather than one! In 1986 I brought over my 350cc LCH Honda which was great fun and ever since Ive ridden my 250cc NSY Sportsmax. Ive only failed to finish twice, firstly in 1989 when I oiled a plug at the Black Dub and then in 1993 when the circlip broke and I stopped at Glentramman. I also rode my 125ccLCH at Billown in 1988 and had four very enjoyable laps picking off some 7R.s as I went. <br /><br />Lens involvement in motorcycle racing other than his TT responsibilities include 15 years as a delegate on the ACU General Council, for the Southern Centre until 1994, and now as a delegate for the New Era Club. He was Clerk of the Course at Thruxton from 1980 until 1985 and then deputy Clerk of the Course from 1986 until 1991. He then went on to hold the position of Chief Executive Officer at Thruxton. His role with Southern Centre included being a steward at other motorcycle events such as grass track and trials as well as road races. In 1994 he also helped a novice rider, Peter Eaton, with advice and bike preparation and this continued into 1995. Len said: ""Peters very keen and enthusiastic and is going about it the right way. I am not prepared to spoon feed but as long as he listens and works hard I will give him all the assistance I can.""<br /><br />Lens commitment to motorcycle racing was total and this was recognised when the late Dave and Alison Morris, of Chrysalis Racing fame. They nominated him for life membership of the Southampton and District Motorcycle Club which he proudly accepted. Was there anything other than motorcycling in Lens life? ""Yes! I have a great love for playing the electronic organ and theres my wife Winifred. We celebrated our 50th wedding anniversary in 1991, but, as she says, everything turns to motorcycle talk.""<br /><br />Len made his last trip to his beloved Isle of Man to participate in the 2000 TT Classic Parade. Since that time he has not enjoyed the best of health and passed away peacefully on Wednesday 23rd October 2002. The motorcycle world has been greatly enriched by Lens contribution and is now that much poorer with his passing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Mike Hammonds<br /><br />January 1995<br /><br />October 2002<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2df488b4cb2e6c2e94fe308f7c55c03f.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Its always been a rollercoaster ride for the diminutive Kiwi with outstanding performances offset by heartache and injury. He continues to bounce back and anyone who is writing him off after a lacklustre 2004 (where a solitary 12th place was all he had to show for his efforts) does so at their peril. Only Lougher has more experience and only Farquhar can rival his determination.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7c88055d52be574b9093565d7061e02c.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/49dafa58ac3d9ed0ca3d0f94a2090ac0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/dc9f76bf60ac464bd43deca1c6b8ff9b.jpg,,,,2,0,0,3,2,2,1,3,0,1,4,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,14

Deciding he wanted something bigger he tried for a short time the 1000cc Vincent machine 'Gunga Din' and a Vincent Black Lightening before returning to Norton Watsonian.<br /><br />1955 saw a change to Matchless and in finally in1958 due to lack of full works support he moved to long stroke BMW engines.  <br /><br />His first one (having to fund himself and the budget being rather tight!) bought on a half share with Jack Beeton. <br /><br />Pip had two 'main' passengers. Firstly Charles Billingham and then Ray Campbell who proved to be his regular long-term passenger.<br /><br />His biggest disappointment was never winning the Isle of Man TT.  Although he had a pair of second placings and two thirds.<br /><br />His greatest race was the 1960 Dutch TT obviously because it was his first and only Grand Prix win. This was the year he was ranked 3rd in the world sidecar championship behind Germany's Helmut Fath and Swiss Fritz Scheidegger.<br /><br />His favourite English course was Oulton Park, (I remember this circuit too). Indeed his final meeting was at this circuit in 1973. <br /><br />Pip  won the ACU British Championship Sidecar Event 3 times.  He was the first winner of the 500 sidecar event, a lot of money back then!!<br /><br />His international results were<br /><br />Belgian Grand Prix  1951 - 3rd, 1956 - 2nd<br /><br />Italian Grand Prix 1951 - 3rd, 1956 - 2nd<br /><br />Dutch TT  1960 1st<br /><br />A few asides:-<br /><br />Pip always enjoyed a good scrap with Chris Vincent.<br /><br />One race he particularly remembered was breaking the Silverstone lap record by 5 mph, starting from scratch, beating the works Nortons.<br /><br />I asked him to sum up how he felt about his racing career he said'I enjoyed every minute of it'.<br /><br /><br /><br />(A very proud daughter)Caroline Skelton  nee Harris<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2ffb3fea18c7504e0e1707b5a6d8ef77.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7f5fbacfaf432f5b4961138fbd5010ad.jpg,,,,,0,2,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

Running tight against the curb on the left, he pins the throttle wide open on a full downhill charge, the bellow from the open megaphone echoing off the low brick walls lining the road. He pinpoints the right-hand curve at the bottom of the hill, skimming the kerbstones. The bump at the bottom of the Bray compresses the suspension to its limit, throwing the rider's knees into his chest. With a headshake, the bike accelerates away to the cheers of the crowd. The year was 1954, and this young, Canadian rookie from Victoria, BC was living his dream of racing in the Isle of Mann TT.<br /><br />Havens had had a successful racing career in Canada, winning the 350cc BC championship in 1952. The following year he came third in the Canadian Nationals, and then made up his mind to race in the TT. So, in the company of his friend and fellow racer Bob Cooper, Havens headed off on a five-day trip to New York by train. Catching the boat to Liverpool, they landed in England on a cold January day in 1954 and marched straight to the old AMC factory, where they both found work.<br /><br />The two Canadian lads purchased new AJS 7Rs and got their feet wet by racing the bikes at Silverstone and Brands Hatch. In May they quit their jobs and headed off for the Isle of Man to race in the TT, which Havens describes as, ""A good education."" The two small town boys from rural Victoria were thrown in at the deep-end, racing against the world's best riders including John Hartle, Rod Coleman, Ray Amm and the legendary Bob McIntyre, on the toughest circuit in the world.<br /><br />Unfortunately Cooper crashed heavily in practice and wrecked his machine, so Havens was on his own. Rod Coleman won the 350cc junior TT that year at an average speed of 91 mph, but in a field of 90 riders, Havens placed 15th, winning a Silver Replica at 84.8 mph. A young racer by the name of John Surtees was just ahead in 11th place at 85.4 mph. Havens took a second bronze trophy riding the 350 7R in the 500cc event and, incidentally, was the first 350cc bike home. A fabulous result for the young Canadian rookie.<br /><br />Inspired by his success at the TT, Ted entered the Ulster GP in Ireland and it was there disaster struck. He crashed the 7R and was badly injured, lying in hospital unconscious for a week. Upon recovery, he caught the boat back home to Canada with his bike. Out of work and money, the AJS was sold and then went through a succession of owners, one of whom succeeding in blowing up the 7R's engine by dropping a valve into the cylinder.<br /><br />For $350 the AJS 7R was sold to a local dealer who promptly removed the original engine, replacing it first with a BSA twin, and later on with, heaven forbid, a Triumph twin engine. This was a popular cafe racer conversion for an old race bike in the early '60s. The original 7R motor was sold for spare parts to another racer, who later sold it to an enthusiast who carefully put it into a dry wooden box and stored it in his mother's attic where it lay for the next 30 years.<br /><br />It is here my old friend Murray Neibel, owner of Modern Motorcycling Ltd. in Vancouver, enters the story. Murray campaigned a Manx Norton in the '60s at the old Westwood track. After taking the chequered (lag at the end of a race, he slowed, only to be rear ended by the second place rider who just happened to be piloting that very same AJS 7R/Triumph special.<br /><br />This was Murray's first encounter with the bike, but 10 years later he ran into the AJS 7R/Triumph again, this time at a swap meet in Portland during the 1970s.<br /><br />Then the 7R/Triumph special disappeared for nearly three decades.<br /><br />Some 25 years later, the owner of the 7R engine entered Murray's shop and told him about the engine he had in storage in the attic. Murray purchased the engine in 1995 and set about locating the rest of the bike he had long forgotten about. An ad he placed in the personals column of the local newspaper, """"Ageing biker seeks relationship with older British motorcycle,"" turned tip a few leads on other collectibles, but no AJS 7R.<br /><br />Finally, a chance conversation with another enthusiast led Murray to a house in Burnaby. The owner had moved to the United States, but his mother said all of his furniture and other belongings were stored in the garage. Inviting him in for tea, the old lady spoke to Murray of her son's interest in old motorcycles and said she thought there was an old bike in the garage. Following more tea, they decided to take a look. Buried beneath the old furniture Murray spotted a familiar oil cap peeking out from behind some boxeshe had found the AJS 7R.<br /><br />Following months of long distance negotiation with the owner, the vintage machine was purchased and brought back to the shop for restoration. After being apart for four decades, the engine and the frame were together again. Even better, Ted Havens, a regular visitor to Murray's shop, identified the bike as being the original AJS 7R he had raced at the Isle of Man TT races in 1954. More than 40 years later, man and machine were re-united.<br /><br />Ted assisted Murray with the pain-staking restoration, a labour of love for them both. A new tank and seat were ordered from England, while the damaged 7R motor was fitted with a new crankpin, piston, rocker arms and valves. Extra struts that had been welded onto the frame in order to fit the Triumph motor were removed and the frame was restored to factory specs.<br /><br /> The original ""Jampot"" rear suspension units that had been replaced when the AJS was fitted with the Triumph engine were found in the same local dealer's garage where they had been quietly waiting for 40 years.<br /><br />Now fully restored to pristine condition, this particular AJS 7R-one of only 40 built by the factory that year-has been conservatively valued at $25,000. But for Havens and Neibel it's priceless.<br /><br />Inasmuch as the AJS overcame grievous injuries to be re born, Havens too recovered from his accident in Ireland and continued his racing career in Canada, setting the Westwood lap record on a G50 Matchless in 1961. He retired from racing in 1964 only to return again in 1986, to race a GSX-8750 at the age of 60! Now in his 70s, Ted regularly rides an 1100cc Suzuki streetbike, and you probably won't be able to catch him through the twisty bits.<br /><br />After years of storage and scads of not-so-surgical alterations, the major components of this venerable racer were reunited and restored to the factory's original good intentions.	<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks to Shane Kenneally, Canadian Biker<br /><br />and thanks Ted... <br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/18e8c0cadd70f580b19be2d70e6e4a92.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e6fa187aa4584b23667d375b230c1d96.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ce59478b468edbac9283a939ef80c24e.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tonys inspiration was a picture of Mike Hailwood riding a MV Augusta, which caused considerable distraction during school mathematics lessons. <br /><br />Tonys heroes were Mike Hailwood, Giacomo Agostini and Bill Ivy, whom he was honoured to meet during his career. During his club and national racing career, Tony raced the ex-Vic Camp/Alan Dunscombe 750cc Ducati (the first in the UK) and finished 3rd in the clubmans national championship. Tony quickly progressed to national and international events, riding a well used Yamaha TZ350A. Tony then formed a friendship with grass track racer, Paul Pinfold, and built the 'Pinfold' framed Yamaha 250cc and 350cc which were campaigned around England and Ulster.<br /><br />Tony won the newcomers award at the NW200 in 1979. During the same period from 1976 to 1979, Tony rode the Devimead 125cc Hondas in the Honda Championship, winning many events and finishing 3rd overall. <br /><br />During this time, Tony had started riding in international events in mainland Europe, and had notable successes at Heerlen, Ammerzoden, Tubbergen and Chimay. In 1979, Tony went semi-professional, taking unpaid leave from his job as a telephone engineer in Coventry. After purchasing a new, but year old TZ350E from Yamaha Amsterdam, he traveled to Salzburgring for the first European G.P. With no 'start' in the 350cc class, Tony managed to persuade the infamous Dr Bauer to give him a start in the 500cc event, but faced with only two remaining qualifying sessions and a wet track, he failed to qualify. <br /><br />However, the next G.P was at Hockenheim, where the race organisers were more sympathetic. Tony qualified easily for the 350cc race and finished 14th, beating Grand Prix regular Chas Mortimer to be the best British rider. The organisers at the British G.P. proved even more reluctant to give the fledgling star a ride at Silverstone, but eventually relented. Tony finished 8th in the 350cc and 10th in the 250cc events, again by far the best British performance. With World Championship points in the bag, Tony continued for the rest of the season in the Grand Prix Circus. <br /><br />Tony continued riding G.P.s until 1985, with 4th at the Swedish G.P., 5th in the French at Le Mans, and a host of Top Ten and nearly Top Ten places. During his career, Tony rode the Waddon Ehrlich 250 to 4th at Daytona in 1980, won the Bill Ivy Silver Helmet at Brands Hatch (where he held the 350cc lap record), the Armstrong 250 to 4th place at Anderstorp, and his own 750cc Yamaha to 15th place in the Daytona 200 (with a broken gearbox for the last five laps !). Winding down his professional racing career, Tony raced TT Formula II with the help of Terry Shephard, and finished 2nd in the British Championship. He also campaigned a Honda NS400R in the TT Formula 1 class over the same period, giving many a GSXR750 a big surprise! <br /><br />Tony retired from full-time racing in 1986 to become a university student at the age of 34. He won his final professional race at Brands Hatch 'Race of the South'.  He continued as a 'holiday racer', competing in the Ulster G.P. and NW200 until 1979, when he decided that he was an ageing rider riding far too quickly on ageing bikes, trying to keep up with nice new shiny ones! Permanent retirement was overdue. <br /><br />Tony studied psychology and physical education achieving a BSc (Hons) in 1980, an MSc in Sport Sciences in 1992, and  PhD in Medical Science in 1995, all at the University of Birmingham. Tony currently works at Cranfield University, where he specialises in Human Factors in Aviation. Tony flies gliders in competitions at RAF Bicester, and also holds a commercial pilots license with instructor and multi-engine ratings. <br /><br />Tony still has his original 1978 TZ350E, which is in a permanent state of rebuild, and he rides a Honda VFR800i on warm days!",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/825d3358d3a796bfa8d390cc372835ce.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/89d947570080c662a390da28ad7cc312.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6449df80d8412639881aef9a64b95b24.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

He also raced at Cadwell Park, Oulton Park, Three Sisters Croft and Elvington.<br /><br />1997 saw Dereks first appearance at Scarboroughs Olivers Mount circuit as well as the Manx Grand Prix where he finished 3rd in the Newcomers race.  Derek ended the year with three Auto 66 Club Championship trophies.<br /><br />At the start of the 1998 season, Derek bought a Yamaha Thundercat and at Scarborough achieved regular top ten finishes - including a win in the B Final  and always finished in the top ten at Croft.  He also raced well at the Isle of Man in the Manx Grand Prix reaching average lap speeds of 106mph and was awarded another silver replica.<br /><br />1999 started well with Derek a strong contender in the 600cc and Open classes of the North East Motor Cycle racing Club championships, fiercely contended by top riders from Scotland as well as the North East at both Croft and East Fortune circuits.<br /><br /> In May, Derek was also fortunate to gain entry at the North West 200 in Northern Ireland finishing in both 600cc and 750cc races on his ageing Thundercat.  He decided, with the help of sponsors to purchase his current bike, a Yamaha R6, which was prepared just in time for the Manx GP where he finished 18th in the Junior race averaging 108.72mph and 10th in the Senior race averaging 109.36mph with laps of over 110mph.  On returning home, he finished the season with further wins at Croft and East Fortune to become N.E.M.C.R.C. Club Champion as well as A.C.U. Champion in both 600cc and Open classes.<br /><br />In 2000 Derek has finished 2nd in the 600cc National race and 3rd in the Gold Cup at Scarborough beating top names and building quite a following from the huge crowds!<br /><br />In June M &amp; S Motorcycles provided Derek with a Honda Fireblade to race in the production class at the T.T. Races on the Isle of Man where he managed to increase his lap speeds of last years Manx GP Unfortunately on race day, torrential rain saw race speeds drop but Derek managed a respectable finish.<br /><br />At Croft and East Fortune Derek was holding on to top spot in the North East Championships, defending his titles.<br /><br />A return to the Manx GP in August saw average speeds of 111mph in the Junior, finishing 8th and 112mph in the Senior, finishing 11th.  On return, in the early hours of the morning the Van and Caravan were broken into outside the house and his race bike, leather, helmets, gloves, boots, tools and paddock bike were stolen.   Although the bike was returned, Derek was unable to race again this season, missing Scarborough and the remaining rounds in the championship.<br /><br />In 2002 Derek will race again at Scarborough and the Isle of Man also in Ireland at the North West 200 and the Ulster Grand Prix.<br /><br />Thanks to Derek for providing the above information.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/fb09ad5e16627bbfabfa04dda6aec7ad.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ee529d7c2c32739db4dc894caa6d461c.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A further prang at the 71 North West meant that he missed that years TT.However, Tom returned to relearn the course in 1972  this time it was the machines that prevented him finishing any of the three races he started!1973 saw him take 9the place in the Lightweight 250 TT, but was a retirement in the Junior.Nineteen Seventy-four saw Tom Herron entered in four classes, 250; 350; Senior and the 125! It turned out to be a good TT for him, picking up four silver replicas. He was 4th in the 250, 4th again in the 350, 3rd in the 125 and took 15th in the Senior.Herron return to the podium in 1975 achieving another third place, this time in the Junior class.Toms big ambition was to win a TT  1976 was to realise his wish, with not one but two magnificent wins on the Mountain Course.  He opened his account with a record breaking win in the Lightweight 250 at 103.55 mph and put the icing on the cake in the blue-riband Senior TT, winning by 3.4 seconds from Ian Richards, setting a new lap record at 112.27 mph in the process.Two further podium places were gained in 1977, a third in the Junior 250 and an excellent second in the Senior TT on his 348cc Yamaha.Nineteen Seventy-eight saw the very popular Ulsterman arrive on the Island straight from an excellent North West achieving a double victory.He was entered in the F1 and was up against comeback rider, Mike Hailwood  he held onto the great man for two laps, but the frame of his Honda broke forcing him to retire on the third of the six laps.In the senior on Jim Finlays RG500 Suzuki he had a dramatic battle with Californian Pat Hennon, Tom eventually taking the chequered flag with a race record of 111.74 mph.Unknown to all concerned at the time, the Junior TT where Tom finished third was to be his final race on the Mountain Course, as he was fatally injured during the 1979 North West 200 in his native Northern Ireland.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/0d087860cb914e0c6cbbde9fb2a297aa.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/37ccb63182b39b91de4389155199a6d2.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/52f6a60854cad91df7df7f47911be7b1.jpg,,,,3,1,4,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12

The following year he returned riding for the pride of the Italian factories  MV Agusta, taking victory in the Lightweight TT, despite the challenge from the fledgling Honda concern.1961 was to prove a frustrating year, with only a best placing of second in the Junior, behind a Norton mounted Phil Read.Nineteen Sixty-two was to prove to be Garys final year at the TT, despite securing his second win, this time in the blue-riband Senior Race on the four cylinder fire engine.The death of his close friend and rival Tom Phillis brought bout the Rhodesians retirement from the sport.

Riding for the German NSU works team he made an impressive debut in the Lightweight 250cc TT.Reduced to a three laps of the Mountain Course, in what was a rare massed start race, he came home runner-up to teammate Werner Haas who had led from start to finish.In the first event on the 10.79 Clypse Course, the Ultra Lightweight [125cc] proved to be a great success, despite there being only nine finishers in the ten lap race. Austrian Hollaus and Italian Carlo Ubbiali [MV] fought a real short circuit battle throughout, with the NSU mounted rider taking the chequered flag by just four seconds. Such was the pace that third placed Cecil Sandford was nearly four and a half minutes adrift, while Haas, crashed without injury in his attempt to catch the two leaders.Unfortunately, he was killed in practice for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, later that year.Ruppert Hollaus became the first posthumous World Champion in 1954, in the 125cc class and was runner up to Werner Haas in the 250cc category.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/37b5b9db8a9bc89ca4974ff04c801516.jpg,,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Entering the Manx later in the year. Joining Castrol in 1954 necessitated moved to England, where his still lives, in semi retirement in Southport.After achieving the double in 57, Alan went on to the TT in 1958, riding a brace of works Nortons, with world champion Keith Campbell, as his teammate.His racing career came to an abrupt end at the final meeting of the 1958 season at Oulton Park, when he came off the Norton at Island Bend, suffering a fractured scull, which resulted in double vision, which has plagued him ever since.To summarise Alan Holmes Manx career, he entered eight races, finishing in five, collecting five replicas, setting three record laps and was a member of the winning Club Team on three occasions. Alan was awarded the Lady Hill Rose Bowl, for the best performance by a Manxman in 1957.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/34378c156525f7c967f44cd8e85634cf.jpg,,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The first dry and mist free practice I had the gear lever broke off on the approach to Ballacraine. I coasted up the slip road where one of the spectators asked me what the problem was. I explained whereupon he told me he had a Blacksmiths Forge just down the road. I wheeled the bike down there and he removed the splined boss and fashioned a gearlever from a piece of old rod and welded it to the boss. I then finished the practice lap in something like an hour and 10 minutes!!<br /><br />For race day I taped this fabricated lever inside the fairing along with a spanner - just in case! I had bought a new item in the meantime. Sure enough, halfway around the first lap the lever broke again. I stopped and removed the old part and fitted the fabricated item to complete the race. <br /><br />Unfortunately, my low starting position (around 110 I think), combined with this delay meant the leader passed me before I reached the finish line for the last time and was thus classified as a non finisher.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/53f5a463c15e86587d3d3b67c7e99e53.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Making its first appearance in 1953 it had an all welded frame with pivoted fork rear suspension. The top tubes give a Featherbed-like appearance but terminated with a crosspiece, just above the swinging arm pivot with the rear sub frame being bolted on. The headstock was exceptionally well braced.Woodhead-Monroe hydraulic shock absorbers supplied the rear damping with AJS Teledraulic forks up front. The brake drums were large diameter Al-Fin light alloy type bolted to wheel hubs turned from solid duralumin bar with press two-inch bearings. Both petrol and oil tanks were hand formed from aluminium sheet by Greig.<br /><br />The power unit was initially a home tuned 1936 Rudge Rapid, the head having been modified to take hairpin valve springs. Not content with its performance the next step was to create a power unit to their own specification. By 1953 the only Rudge parts still in use, apart from the clutch and gearbox, were the crankshaft and crankcase which was  topped by an Al-fin barrel and light alloy cylinder head incorporating bronze valve-seat inserts again with hairpin springs. The oil pump was a BSA unit driven off the magneto spindle. Everything was produced by father and son in a small workshop in Perth, Scotland with little more in the way of power tools other than a welding set, vertical drill and Myford lathe.<br /><br />On several occasions, [including Jacks first practice lap of the TT when he had to pull in at Quarterbridge] the plug oiled up. When the problem could not be cured, the magneto was sent away for testing but came back with a clean bill of health but the fault still persisted. However when a replacement unit was fitted the problem disappeared. On closer investigation the inner windings were proved to be breaking down at high revs. This had not shown up during the bench test as the drive was via a flexible coupling which did not submit the unit to the same loading it received on the bike.<br /><br />Jack raced for many years taking in several TTs. He was 15th in 1953 on the Rudge, 10th the following year again on the Rudge, 13th in 1957 (NSU, another father and son self-built racer) and 16th in 1961 on an Ariel. The Horne-Rudge, with its deep red, silver and black colour scheme, won the Scottish Championship in its lifetime.<br /><br />Jack also raced it in the North West 200, Leinster 110 and Ulster Grand Prix, being placed 5th in 1954 and winning the 250cc Handicap Award.<br /><br />Around 1955/6  T E Rutherford from Hawick purchased the machine and raced it for a season before it passed across the border to Jim Darling (whose grandfather won a TT Sidecar event in the late twenties). When not racing John used it on the roads with a fishtail from a Bantam held on with two self-tapping screws to reduce the noise but on more than one occasion, when changing down and opening the throttle, the end was blown off and the bike leapt forward!<br /><br />On the arrival of his call-up papers in 1964 he sold it to a work colleague, Paul Hutchinson, for 40 who subsequently exchanged it later that year at a Newcastle Ford Dealership for a Ford Zephyr Zodiac. Billy and Cecil Winthrop from the village of Thropton were the next owners. However the original engine/gearbox had gone awol, being replaced by a standard 2-valve unit.<br /><br />IN 1970 John Vickery (an engineer who was involved with the HJH motorcycle concern which manufactured Villiers powered lightweights in Neath in the mid 50s) acquired the remains, thinking it would be an interesting retirement project. Following the theft of the fully rebuilt engine and gearbox, John understandably lost interest in the project. In early 2002 Les Leach bought the remains and has got the Horne-Rudge back on the road, using it at vintage events.<br /><br />Some years ago T E Rutherford managed to retrieve the original power unit, which, following restoration, is on display in a Lake District museum.<br /><br />(Historical) note: T E Rutherford sold the Horne-Rudge to Jim Darling as Greig Horne had constructed a NSU Sports Max based racer for him to ride. This NSU machine was later sold on to an up-and-coming racer named Phil Read.)<br /><br /><br /><br />Information kindly supplied by John Switzer.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2df02bf52a07ad4ae9ce455207178779.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/37ec846fbbcfb94328c437d655d3da8f.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A year later, Mr Ireland was voted New Zealand motorcycle sportsman of the year. <br /><br />During two decades of mainly European events, he raced beside - and sometimes beat - some of the greats in motorcycle racing. He won the Belgian Grand Prix in 1979 and the 1982 Isle of Man TT feature event, plus a brace of impressive placings from around the highly competitive European circuit. <br /><br />However, in 1979 after winning the grand prix, while contracted to the Suzuki Great Britain team, a publicity photo-shoot went ""wildly wrong"" and he crashed his motorcycle into a concrete post. <br /><br />He spent five months in hospital and had 11 operations on his leg, ankle, foot, and tendons. <br /><br />While in hospital, he met his future wife, Angela, a nurse. The couple now have three teenage daughters. <br /><br />Weeks after the birth of his first daughter, Mr Ireland retired and became involved in the heavy commercial transport industry in England. He returned to Dunedin with his family more than 18 months ago - with 10 imported trucks of varying sizes. <br /><br />""We always wanted to return home it just took a little longer than anticipated,"" he said. <br /><br />Part of the business plan included a Kawasaki service truck which would travel to motocross meetings and a pending sponsorship announcement of a 600cc road-racing motorcyclist in New Zealand. <br /><br />Mr Ireland expected the business to be fully operational within three months, and to employ about 10 staff. <br /><br />Information provided by Simon Hartley  July 2004<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/81d556ee1a666f9e013ea2d364db5c52.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b5a9efa35b829f98c2408321bafc2b1b.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/296d3a5bd944cdb157cc1aa07a4d56cd.jpg,,,,1,0,2,1,0,1,2,0,1,0,2,1,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12

The diminutive star had arrived! A seventh place in the 1963 50cc Race on a Sheene Special indicated Ivys talent and Yamaha were quick to snap him up. His battles with Phil Read certainly livened up the smaller classes at the TT during this era. He won just two races, the 1966 125cc and the 1968 Lightweight. But on finishing second in the 1968 125cc he made history, the first man to lap at over 100mph on a 125cc machine.

He missed 1997 due to injury, but came back in 1998 to finish fourth in the Senior and Production Races. After showing blistering form at the Northwest 200 Races in 1999, Jefferies came to the Island hoping to repeat his Irish success. He was not denied and joined the elite band of riders to record a hat-trick with victories in the Formula One, Production and Senior. Just for good measure he hopped onto the second spot on the podium in the Junior Race too. In 2000 he again won three races, Junior, Production and Senior and on the last lap of the Senior took the absolute lap record in 18mins 00.6secs - at a brilliant 125.69mph. <br /><br />With no TT in 2001, due to the foot &amp; mouth crisis in the United Kingdom, TT fans had an extra twelve months to wait to see DJ achieve his third consecutive hat-trick of wins in the Formula One, Production and Senior TTs. Once again increasing the absolute course lap record to 127.  mph!<br /><br />Hopes of  more scintillating race victories and lap records in 2003 were dashed when the affable gentle giant was killed instantly in a practice crash on  the Thursday afternoon.<br /><br />Always smiling DJ leaves an impressive TT record and countless memories for all enthusiasts of the races to admire and recall. <br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e3f16cc53dec1f0751a9cd6a242202ff.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/dbb4c5ce128722e3c0848ddc7be3fbb4.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6ae0985a8f38bef975e8437386a6cad1.jpg,,,,9,1,0,2,0,0,1,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

427,C W [Paddy] Johnston,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=427&filter=J,N,"Now heres a little story...<br /><br />In 1921 two young Irish lads went to see the T.T. for the first time.  They agreed that they could do as well as any of the riders that they could see. <br /><br />One of them was <a href=""/results/rider.asp?Ride_id=403"">Stanley Woods</a> the other was Paddy Johnston. They both wangled rides for the next year. <br /><br />Paddy&#8217;s first success was in 1925 when he was second riding Cottons in both the light-weight and ultra light-weight T.T.s. <br /><br />In 1926 he won a thrilling light-weight T.T. race by 20 seconds from Pietro Ghersi, who was disqualified from <u>second</u> place - NOT <u>first</u> as has been inaccurately reported in some motorcycling books. Both riders set out with just a minute interval so it was very much a real race.  The win was achieved despite losing all but top gear for the last lap. <br /><br />He was again second in the lightweight in 1930. His last T.T. was in 1951, when he kept praying that his Villiers-engined Sun would break down as, <i>""I could have got off and walked faster than the gutless heap!""</i>  He came 16th. <br /><br />An all rounder, Paddy was one of the few T.T. winners to also win a Scottish International Six Days Trail.  He also had an entry for the 1927 Grand National, but was stopped from riding in it due to contract problems; <i>""You&#8217;re paid to break your neck racing motorcycles, not horses""</i>, said Bill Cotton. <br /><br />Kindly supplied by Doug Johnston.",,,,,,,1,3,0,0,2,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,19

He served two years in the trenches then transferred to the Royal Flying Corps.  <br /><br />He was severely wounded when he was shot down in flames, and he was awarded the Military Cross (M.C.).  He never fully recovered his health and lived in retirement until his death in 1950.  He was twice married and had three sons, two of when died in World War Two.<br /><br />We know from his obituary that he was an enthusiastic pioneer of motor racing and rode as an amateur in TT races.

During the First World War he served in the RNVR and RFC.  As a Levis rider he won the first Victory Trial to be staged by the Birmingham MCC in 1919 and the following year finished second in the 250cc class of the Junior TT.  In 1922 he rode a Sun in the 250cc Lightweight class but over-lightening of engine components gave rise to excessive vibration, which caused the fuel lines to fracture.  Nevertheless Gus and L J Lord finished in 12th and 13th places after wrapping handkerchiefs around the fuel pipes to staunch the leaking.  He competed in 1924 and 1925 TTs on Douglas, Omega and Velocette (DNF every time!) but had better luck in 1926 when he finished 5th in the Junior on a Velocette. <br /><br />He took part in the first speedway meeting in the UK at High Beech in 1928.  As he now had a wife and four daughters to support he spotted that this could be a lucrative career move.  He joined Stamford Bridge as Captain and they won the first Southern League championship in 1929.  When Stamford Bridge closed in 1932 he transferred to Wimbledon where he stayed until 1937.  He then did a stint for Wembley and became captain of the Lea Bridge team.  He represented England in 1930 at the first International Test Match against Australia and often rode for his country in the thirties.  <br /><br />He seems to have been up for anything on two wheels.  He rode the Wall of Death and in a publicity stunt racing against a roller-skater!  He was always his own mechanic and was very popular, both with the fans and his fellow riders.  In the fifties he was still riding trials.<br /><br />He started his own motorcycle business in South London in the thirties and in 1948 a young officer recently demobbed from the Paras joined the firm to manage it for Gus, who had little interest in business.  He fell for the bosss daughter and went on to take the company to greater success.<br /><br />When Norton introduced the Commando in 1968, Gus Kuhn Motors decided to take it racing and so started the second phase of Gus Kuhns association with the TT.  Sadly, Gus had died in 1966, ironically while his daughter and family were on the IoM for the races, and so he did not see this chapter of his story.<br /><br />Quote from Speedway News May 16th 1936  A wily master of track-craft, a brilliant mechanic, a darned hard man to get past (and not only because of his portly figure), and above all a thorough sportsman and a jolly good fellow.<br /><br />Gus gave an interview that was published in the 29th September 1929 edition of The Modern Boy, under the heading of Daredevils of the Speedway.  ....and that reminds me of a very narrow escape I had.  It was the 1920 TT and I was careering down the mountainside at one hundred miles an hour, when a piece of my crankshaft and the flywheel flew twenty feet into the air.  As machine and I disappeared into a ditch by the roadside, that flywheel bounced and made a three-inch hole in the road, bounced again and made a hole in the pavement, finally bouncing over the spectators heads and finding a resting-place in a field, where two hours later it was found.<br /><br />Well, I skidded into the ditch, and but for that lucky skid I would not be alive to tell the tale.  The flywheel would have come down right on my head.  Ambulance men came hurrying to the spot with their stretcher all ready, for everyone thought I was finished.  When they found my bike in the ditch, but no Gus, they were sure.  But when, later, they came into a local inn, and found the missing man standing at the counter drinking lemonade (sic!), they were not quite so confident.<br /><br />I may say that my flywheel adorns that inn even to this day and is pointed out as an historic relic.  <br /><br />I wonder if the flywheel is still there today.<br /><br /><br /><br />Valerie Davey<br /><br />October 2006<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ed3415fa511621682263d8285de0c88e.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

He entered this machine in the Junior Manx Grand Prix of 1960, but was left a quarter-lap short of qualifying after three engine seizures during practice week. <br /><br />In 1966 he was one of three riders in the Reg Dearden Norton team for the Senior race but was put out at Laurel Bank on the first lap with oil pump failure  another engine seizure. <br /><br />In 1967 he came to the Island with his own Senior Norton  the engine and gearbox being the ones used by Bob McIntyre when he was killed at Oulton Park five years earlier. <br /><br />This time, an oil leak smothering the rear tyre caused a practice crash at Ballaspur. Gordon landed on his head and has suffered severe loss of memory ever since (he remembers childhood and schooldays but nothing between 1950 and 1967). <br /><br />He continued racing until 1973, when he broke his spine in two places at Croft.<br /><br />Gordon lives in Scotland and writes books on military subjects, which he says is the outcome of that Ballaspur crash. <br /><br />Because he would forget anything said to him, he took to carrying a notebook everywhere and writing down data. This practice led to his turning facts into books.<br /><br /><br /><br />Gordon has kindly supplied the above information.

Not only did Darran win the race setting race and lap records in the process, be also became the first rider of a 125cc racing machine to lap the Snaefell Mountain Course at over 100 mph in the Manx Grand Prix!The following year, Darran made an impressive debut in the Ultra Lightweight TT, finishing 4th at 106.37 mph. Only 50 seconds behind race winner Ian Lougher, with Owen McNally and Gary Dynes 2nd and 3rd.The year 2000 saw the likable Ulsterman with four rides  the Ultra Lightweight and Lightweight, plus the Junior and Senior TTs.His first ride in the Lightweight resulted in a retirement, followed by 5th in the Ultra Lightweight Race. The Junior presented him with a 15th finishing position, whereas the Senior on the same 600cc Nibbles Yamaha that provided him with his second D.N.F. of the week.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>TT 2005 Detail</b>Darran LindsayAge:		32TT Debut:	1999Wins:		0Podiums:	0Fastest Lap:	115.00mphTeam:		Uel Duncan Racing<br /><br />The ever-cheerful Lindsay returns to the Island for the first time since 2000 in what will be only his third appearance at the TT. However, he has taken two Manx Grand Prix wins and his performances in Ireland over the last three years earmark him as one to watch. It will be his first time on a Superbike so his best chances will come in the Junior events and he is arguably Irelands best 600cc rider, capable of beating anyone on his day. Like Finnegan, a win may be out of reach, but a podium finish would be a good bet.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e119a1de717ab2b567745ecb5ea0c3ca.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/19c0030aa384550051ccc61bc8637e94.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7a309f3aa76b091bf9b9ac157a4af8cd.jpg,,,,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

We''d both been given the same machinery by Suzuki and shared the same house, garage and of course settings etc, which meant that we both ran out of fuel (yeah, I know, stupid ...!) at the same point, so as he''d set off earlier than me he had the pleasure in knowing that atsome point soon the same fate would befall me, so decided to wait therewaiting for me to come round....That was our debut race at the island so welearned fairly quickly that the fuel tanks needed to be slightly bigger thanstandard...out came the compressed airline. The best lap time was 109.96mph<br /><br />In ''89, I DNF''d again, on a Kawasaki 250 riding for the factory for whom I''d signed at the Island due to yet another mechanical failure on the Francis Neal RC30 which allowed me to leave the team for pastures new...Hence riding theKawasaki''s (250 &amp; 750 Prod) in Francis Neal colours. The reason for DNF was due to a crash at the Glen Helen section (the name of the actual bend Ireally don''t know, a left hander before a right over a bridge) caused purelyby my own lack of concentration. A broken ankle being the result. Till thenI was doing OK and was up to 9th place.<br /><br /><br /><br />Best regards<br /><br /><br /><br />Mark LinscottManaging Director<br /><br />Office:              +44 (0)1322 611680<br /><br />Fax:                  +44 (0)1322 611801<br /><br />Mobile:             +44 (0)7831 447166<br /><br />Website:           http://www.track-craft.com<br /><br />Address:           Track Craft Ltd, Unit 2, Park Road Industrial Estate,Park Road, Swanley, Kent BR8 8AH<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Teammate Cecil Sandford finished third.Riding in the nine lap Lightweight 250cc TT on the Clypse Course, Bill enjoyed an all Italian battle between himself on the MV and Cecil Sandford on the Guzzi. Sandford led for the first seven laps, Lomas then seized the advantage and stayed ahead to the chequered flag.Bill Lomas was to have debuted the fabulous Guzzi V8 in the Senior of 1956, but it was not ready in time, so he had to revert to the trusty single cylinder version, which brought him home in 5th place.A racing accident at the early season Imola International in 1957 he retired from road racing.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/564a5e0bc89a5206aeaab9a1b3301930.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d2a8b0e6cce303bd0125fcc0bf8133ed.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/0b7d08c73bb025e9dbac12a0f1f9ec52.jpg,,,,2,0,0,2,3,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9

His first rostrum place finish at the TT came in 1984 when he finished second to Dave Roper in the 500 Historic Race.   Ian has started so far in 111 TT races, taking 10 wins and a further 19 podium places.  Ian is the team manager for the BlackHorse Kawasaki team and competes in their colours.  Certainly the three times Duke Road racing Rankings Champion cannot be discounted when it comes to racing around the Snaefell Mountain Course.  His first rostrum place finish at the TT came in 1984 when he finished second to Dave Roper in the 500 Historic Race. Many thanks to Richard Radcliffe for that snippet of information.  In 1990 he was involved in one of the closest races ever when he set new lap and race records to win the Lightweight 250 Race from Steve Hislop. In 1996 he won the 750cc Class of the Production TT and won the Ultra-Lightweight Race with new lap and race records. He finished second in this race in 1998. He took first place on his 125 Honda in 1999 as well as finishing third in the Senior and fifth in the Formula One. TT 2000 saw Ian score two third places in both the Lightweight 250 and Junior Races on a Honda and Yamaha respectively. Ians fastest speed around the course is 122.93mph.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/9014d3cc11dd94a3b01f4fae6fb3e657.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/81aa425f9bb49c3692b5048e70480e2e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ee63be1ed85af313c75d66ebeb6f81db.jpg,,,,10,14,5,10,8,4,9,1,1,3,5,5,1,5,1,1,0,2,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The museum still exists.<br /><br />Once he told me the following story: <br /><br />Heinz had a wooden leg (foot to knee). Once on the Isle of Man he came off. Heinz and his passenger flying through the air. His wooden leg was in a strange angle in front of him. His passenger came back corrected the wooden leg, and they were in the race again. <br /><br />Heinz said that spectators must have thought that he had lost his leg.

He raced at all the short circuits throughout the North of England, places like Brough, Silloth, and his favourite circuits Cadwell Park &amp; also Olivers Mount in Scarborough. He also took part in various local grass track, sprints and sand racing events.<br /><br />Doug was racing with reasonable success, especially at Cadwell Park, beating people like Sid Barnett and Bill Lomas and picking up decent amounts of prize money with several first places. So in September 1948 he was entered by Middlesbrough Motor Club racing with number 102 in the Manx GP senior event on his Triumph 500 GP machine (engine number T100.97021.R.)  which he had bought new in July that same year. <br /><br />He travelled over to the island with his family and close friend Bill Zealand (who was also competing on a Norton in the Junior race) in Bills removal van, which doubled as a workshop and sleeping quarters for Doug, and his family.  Everything was going all right but during practise he crashed 13 miles from the start and suffered face abrasions and concussion (see newspaper cutting), but nothing serious with himself or his machine and was fit to enter the race the following week.  Doug went on to finish the senior race with an impressive 20th place, just missing out on a replica.  Not bad for a first outing around the tough mountain circuit.<br /><br />Doug''s next trip to the Island was for the 1949 Senior Clubmans TT and entered this time, on a home tuned Triumph 500, racing with number 19. As Middlesbrough Motor Club had already two entrants in this years competition and with each club restricted to two riders, then Scarborough and District Motor Club entered him. Unfortunately Doug didn''t have as much luck as the previous year and retired at Ramsey due to clutch failure. He faced the long journey home very disappointed, but with some hope for the forthcoming September Manx Grand Prix.<br /><br />Entered again on the Triumph 500 GP with race number 77, Doug and his family made the ferry crossing for the 1949 MGP Senior. Doug''s hard work and competitive spirit hadn''t gone un-noticed over his last two visits to the Island and also his varied success around the northern short circuits.  Unknown to Doug the Norton bosses had shown a great deal of interest in him.  They had told his wife before the start of the Senior race that he was to be given a works ride with the Norton Team for the 1950 season.  Doug''s wife Bess was worried by this and decided not to tell him about the Norton offer until after the race, fearing that if he was told and he knew they were watching then he would try too hard and push his luck.<br /><br />During the weeks leading up to the races and during practise week, an argument had been going on between Doug and Avon tyres. Doug was using a new style of racing tyre that Avon had been developing for a while and they insisted on a particularly high pressure which Doug argued was way too high for racing. Avon insisted that was the pressure they were designed to use. Doug finally relented and decided to stay with Avons recommended pressures. <br /><br />He had been doing very well during practice for the Senior and on Saturdays (10th September) practise session he was third fastest with a lap time of 33 m and 1s and a speed of 68.58 mph and was given good marks for neatness around Signpost bend by a Motor Cycling reporter.  W.A.C. McCandless was fastest with 31m 46s and H.J. Kemp second with 32m 4s.<br /><br />During Mondays session he finished sixth fastest in a time of 29m 47s with a speed of 76.02 mph. D. Parkinson topped the leader board with a time of 28m 10s. Dougs speed along the fast Sulby Straight section was recorded at 98.92mph, which put him equal 11th in the speed-stakes, the fastest being that of A.W. Dodds who reached an impressive 106.52mph. A practice official described Doug through Braddan Bridge as loud and fast!<br /><br />Doug lined up for the Thursday morning Senior race still not knowing about the Norton offer. At the end of the first lap Doug lay in sixth position with Duke 1st, McCandless 2nd, Parkinson 3rd, Horn 4th and Crossley 5th, but Doug ped back over the following three laps. As he climbed the mountain mile for the fifth lap his back tyre blew at over 90 mph throwing him off the machine into a wire fence.  As he went through the fence his helmet got caught under the wire and broke his neck.  Un-aware of his injury he stood up in a half conscious daze and wandered very close to the edge the steep mountain mile .<br /><br />Another rider who was passing the scene of the crash that morning spotted Doug and saw him wandering aimlessly near the steep  and went to help.  Saying later that if he hadn''t seen him then Doug would have gone over the edge to certain death.<br /><br />Doug was rushed to Nobles Hospital and x-rayed to find the extent of his injury. Apart from the broken neck, which was bad enough, he sustained no other injuries apart from the usual skin abrasions. Doctors were amazed to find he had a fractured odontoid but were unsure how to treat it as they had never seen this kind of fracture in the living before, usually people with this kind of injury were killed outright!<br /><br />The doctors decided that the best action to take was to fit Doug with a full cast from the stomach to the top of the head and hope for the best. If they could minimise movement then it would have a chance of healing. Doug was in the cast for several months (see photo) and it was very uncomfortable as you can imagine and he found it very difficult to sleep and having to use two knitting needles taped together when he needed to reach an itch under the cast!<br /><br />Doug recovered from his injuries and was advised by the doctors at Nobles Hospital that it would be very foolish to ever consider racing at the Manx or any other motorcycle race again as the next time he might not be as lucky.  Doug took no notice of this good advice and within two years was back on the bike and racing again at all his favourite circuits. He set up his own motorcycle repair business about this time, which made it a lot easier to put his design ideas into motion as well as making a living doing something he enjoyed.<br /><br />He never did go back the Isle of Man to race and said in his own words '' I''d lost my edge. He concentrated more on tuning side and improving frame and suspension designs and carried on racing bikes on the short circuits throughout the 1950''s but only using racing as a way of testing his designs and ideas, from fuel injection, parallelogram swinging arm (which he took out a patent on in 1954), anti-dive forks, central damping forks, gas flowing and so on. He also tried a spot of car racing at the Jim Clark racing school in the early 1960''s, but went back to racing bikes shortly after.<br /><br />Doug finally hung-up his leathers in 1971 after 25 years of almost continuous racing (except the two years out with his broken neck) and took up flying in 1975 and went on to acquire his licence in 1977. He managed to crash twice during his flying career... but that''s another story for another day.<br /><br /><br /><br />Phil Marshall<br /><br />October 2006<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/935c9e49399f1b4ba7ffb34d437cc0c5.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/97eeb5d9504f2a0b0898870c08f9daa4.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/2ae7a165ddff84da0d24cbfb0c885820.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Indeed, but for a puncture which cost him at least ten minutes, he might well have won in 1907.<br /><br />Marshall abruptly retired from racing after finishing sixth in the 1910 TT  the last to be held on the original St Johns course  and so never competed over the Mountain Course.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6281b3de5fbe7dee1b9f7bfb5a8cb28e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/8ccae30caf64f3994c0e054aaa7d1028.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/621e7a7adb43c103e54b845c162eace5.jpg,,,,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

His father was a solicitor, and the family seem to have been reasonably well off. Hugh was at least partly educated at Elizabeth College in Guernsey, before moving north to the great ship building town of Wallsend on the banks of the Tyne in north east England. Here he was apprenticed as a turner at the North East Marine Engineering Co Ltd, which built marine engines. It was also here that he married in 1899.<br /><br />Here it was that he met John Hall (known as Jack), a ""cycle maker""* who had premises on Wallsend High street. Hugh was already a keen and successful pedal cyclist but now was taking an interest in motorised machines. Together they began building motorcycles combining Jacks expertise in cycle production with Hughs knowledge of the internal combustion engine. This usually meant a Minerva/Precision/De Dion/MMC or other proprietary engine adapted to fit into a purpose built frame.<br /><br />These Wallsend built machines of the early 1900s, carrying Hughs personal monogram of HM were the direct forerunners of the NUT marque.<br /><br />Around the beginning of 1912 Sir William Angus, Sanderson &amp; Co Ltd began producing, from their St Thomas St., Newcastle premises, the first motorcycles designated NUT (which stood for Newcastle Upon Tyne) employing the twin expertise of, I believe, Jack Hall, and certainly that of Hugh Mason. Mason acted as manager, designer, test rider and racer. Although Mason had ridden before in the IOM TT (in 1911 [Senior retired] and 1912 [Senior 7th] both for Matchless), and had a formidable reputation in trials and speed events, it was 1913 which was to be his and NUTs annus mirabilis.<br /><br />In that year, Mason and his works NUT machines, amongst other achievements, captured the Brooklands Junior TT, The Isle Of Man Junior TT, The Scottish Lightweight Championship, The Brooklands Six Hour Race, and the Brooklands Solo Ten Mile Scratch Race, as well as establishing ten long distance records in the 350cc class.<br /><br />Neither Mason nor NUT was ever again to repeat such success. In the following year, 1914, Mason was forced to retire in the junior TT and came 7th in the senior. War soon intervened, and the larger works at South Benwell to which NUT production had removed due to their success and swelling order book, was given over to munitions manufacture.<br /><br />After the war Mason wanted to resume development of sports machines, but was overruled by the board of Sir William Angus, Sanderson Ltd who favoured a more luxurious touring machine. Worse, in 1920 the company diverted its investment away from motorcycle production altogether to concentrate on car manufacture, and the motorcycling arm of the company went into liquidation.<br /><br />This was not the end though, and the company was reorganised and reconstituted, and resumed production of machines from the opposite bank of the Tyne near Swalwell under the name Hugh Mason &amp; Co Ltd, NUT Works, Derwenthaugh. However, by the end of 1923 Mason had severed his connection with NUT forever, and set up his own dealership in Newcastle as a representative for Matchless. He had had a longstanding relationship with Matchless both before his NUT adventure, and now afterwards, and had been good friends with the Collier brothers for years.<br /><br />Riding a Matchless, Mason had a last bash at the TT in 1923 at the age of 45, fully 10 years after his great success. It was to be an anti-climax and Mason was forced to retire from the Senior TT with mechanical trouble.<br /><br />Appropriately, Mason died astride his machine near his home at Stamfordham near Newcastle. He was not racing, nor even competing, but had merely set out from his home for a run on his motorcycle prior to taking part in a speed event at a gymkhana that was to take place next day. No one else was involved and the coroner recorded the death as accidental. He had simply been thrown from his machine for reasons unknown and had fractured the base of his skull. He was aged 50 and the year was 1928.<br /><br /><b>The 1913 Junior TT</b><br /><br />Mason was a small tenacious rider possessed of a quiet confidence, and the manner in which he won the 1913 TT was quite remarkable.<br /><br />While on a practice lap in fog on the Monday preceding the race, Mason came off his machine badly and lay by the road unconscious for some time. He was discovered by the Collier brothers, and was eventually taken to Douglas Hospital, where he more or less slept continuously till the start of the race on Wednesday.<br /><br />He was by no means fully recovered and, amazingly, having started the race, he promptly fell off again, this time at Quarter Bridge, ""....and this seemed to waken him up....""**! This seems to have been quite true and he was spurred on so that by the time he reached the mountains he had overtaken the eleven men ahead of him. However he was suffering greatly with headaches as a result of the earlier accident and began to feel ill again and this caused him to vomit as he rode. However he survived the first day, and it was a great relief to him when it was over.<br /><br /> He went back to hospital and slept again, this time through to Friday and the start of the second days racing. He was still troubled with headaches and vomiting but managed to keep going. On reaching Ramsey for the third circuit he was told that another rider was over _ minute ahead of him. Mason complained that he had not been told earlier, but came the reply that they feared for his safety and did not want to urge him to go any faster in his condition. Needless to say, he did go faster, made up the deficit, and eventually won in the time of 5 hrs 8 mins 34 sec. His friend and NUT colleague Robert Ellis came in 8th riding a similar machine.<br /><br />""You see, I knew I had the fastest machine, and without trouble I knew I could win. I was determined to win, but it was very hard to keep awake, and once I was off the machine I wanted to go to sleep""**<br /><br />As a post script it is interesting to note that had things been slightly different, I believe Mason would also have won the 1912 junior TT. Consider the following, which appeared in the Newcastle Illustrated Chronicle on Sat 7th June 1913 following Masons victory: -<br /><br />""In last year's Tourist Trophy Race, Mr. Mason was unfortunate in meeting with an accident a day or so before the actual race, and in consequence he was unable to take part in the competition. However, Mr. Robert Ellis, a well-known motor enthusiast of this town (Newcastle), riding a similar machine, achieved third place, for which he received a special prize, being the leading amateur rider in the competition.""<br /><br />It appears that 1913 was not the only year in which Mason had an accident immediately prior to the TT race...<br /><br /><br /><br />Terry Gay 2002<br /><br />Please click on my email link: <a href=""mailto: terrymacabre@hotmail.com"">Terry Gay</a> if you wish to contact me for any reason regarding this article.<br /><br />Picture credits: -<br /><br />1.

The first of his eleven TT wins came in 1992 with victory in the Formula 1 and he added the Supersport 600 title as well. He also cemented his name in the TT history books in 1996 when he became the first - and only - rider to win four races in one week - the Formula 1, Senior, Junior and Production - he almost made it five when he led the Lightweight for the first two laps before finishing fourth. It was an astonishing run of form - at his peak McCallen was unbeatable.

The following year he again rode the Junior on a 350 AJS 7R and after several impressive lap times, was selected onto the Matchless team for the Senior on a 500cc G50. The other members selected for the team were Ron Langston and Derek Powell, who along with Billy, picked up the Manufacturers award.   Billys best finishes included two top six placings in the 1964 and the 1965 Senior TT Races, both aboard 500cc Matchless G50s. Having competed his entire career on excellently turned out machines, all his TT attempts were ridden against more superior factory machinery with the races holding World Championship status. Having by then moved to the now more competitive Japanese machinery towards the end of his career, Billy rode his final TT in 1975 aboard a 350cc Yamaha in the Junior and a 500cc Suzuki in the Senior races of that year.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ea2e08574dfcb93d0478f2ee356a9df9.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/89254553f82767e686951d4a72798b91.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,3,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7

Later in September that year at the Manx GP, he finished 2nd in the Newcomers 350cc class. Then while lying 2nd on the final lap of the Senior MGP, he ran out of fuel at Hilberry, pushing in to finish 22nd and take the last silver replica. The 1979 MGP saw two 2nd places again in the Junior &amp; Senior races to winners Con Law &amp; Clive Watts respectively.  In the 1980 TT, he had entries in the Senior, Junior &amp; Classic races on Yamaha TZ 250cc and 350cc machines. It was a busy race week after bad weather cancelled the Monday &amp; Tuesday race days. Using one Spondon frame, it was a rebuild of a complete machine for each race day. After a DNF in the Senior, the Junior saw an 11th place finish with a 13th in Fridays Classic, which also saw Joey Dunlops famous victory at a new lap record of 115.40 mph. Later that year, Conor finished 3rd in the Southern 100 championship race in July.  1981 saw hopes high, arriving TT week with a new Yamaha TZ350, new TZ250 power-valve and Joeys previous years TZ500. Some very quick standing start laps on the 250 saw potential for a top three finish. And thanks to the late Jock Taylor, replacement engine crankcases gave him only one Friday practice session lap on the Yamaha TZ500 at 110mph.   However, fate took its course starting in the Senior TT the following Monday, and after a DNF when the front sprocket sheared its teeth at Ballacrye, that race was stopped due to worsening weather on the 3rd lap. Being allowed to restart in Tuesdays re-run Senior and positioned in the first six leaders, Conor crashed heavily in the Black Dub area of the course. Left paralysed from the accident which ended his racing career, he returned several years thereafter to the TT on holidays. There he could be often found at his TT sponsors Hotel RIO(aka the R10) on the Loch Promenade. Since then, hes been involved in the sport in his native Ireland and gainfully employed in Information Technology.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c1e25e9bde2ff16bbd33877cbc9addb0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/70e22de8d9254a3ba30db6eaf520f886.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/9ad219d0fafeaa25ea37b19e634420bb.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Today, with the lap record standing at some 125mph, doing a 100mph lap would not generate a second thought. In 1957, doing the ton was compared to the four minute mile, or breaking the sound barrier! The excitement generated when hard-riding Scotsman Bob McIntyre, on his 500cc four cylinder Gilera, recorded a speed of 101.03 mph was immense. He won the Golden Jubilee Junior Race that year too and his other win came in the 1959 Formula 1 500cc race on a Norton. He joined the Honda team in 1961 and led races with fastest and record laps, but unfortunately retired in every race he rode for the Japanese marque. A popular racer and, as the first man ever to do a 100mph lap - his name is secured in TT history forever.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/202d317a00d3dacd082e50fab742aa77.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/eeede802a8c2922125a54554b8682ad8.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/9746fc089e94f3f2ff4ad0f842dc607e.jpg,,,,3,3,1,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11

Fastest Lap. <br /><br />1929 Senior Amateur TT - Retired with Engine trouble while leading. <br /><br />*Whilst in the lead and on his last lap his throttle cable broke and he stopped at Hillberry.

His one ambition was to be an International Motor Cycle racer and spent many hours riding in the Derbyshire hills.<br /><br />He met his future wife [whilst sitting astride his motor bike] on Chatsworth Road Brampton Chesterfield at the tender age of 15. He told her he was 17 as he feared she would not go out with him if she knew his real age, as she was 21. They married after a seven month courtship despite a somewhat strained relationship with Teds mother saying he couldnt have a girl and a bike as well!.<br /><br />They moved south to Shirley near Birmingham when Ted acquired a position as a works rider for Velocette Motor Cycle Company in York Road, Hall Green Birmingham in 1930 and had two daughters Gladys and Joan.<br /><br />After riding in the TT races he got a lucky break to realise his hearts ambition to be a Continental rider, and in 1938 won the title <b>European Champion</b> and held the title throughout the second world war until racing started again when petrol came off rationing.<br /><br />During the war years he worked in a munitions factory and also was with the voluntary fire service, he was not accepted in the sir force for which he applied as he had slightly defective eyesight even though he held a private air pilots licence. However, although motorcycle racing had been stopped during the war  he wrote articles continually for the <i>Motor Cycle</i> magazine and also other articles on flying and not smoking for other magazines. He also patented the Rotary Valve Engine. Most nights he would sit at his typewriter until the early hours of the morning writing his own biography in fiction form, which at the time of his death was out with the publishers, and as yet, remains unpublished.<br /><br />In 1946 tragedy struck the family two days after moving into a new home in Elwall Road, Hall Green, Birmingham due to a faulty ventilation in the garage [he had complained of feeling dead from the waist down on the day before to his wife as he had been working on a car in the garage], the following day he was pumping the car tyre up as he was running the car engine when he was overcome by carbon monoxide fumes as he and his wifes brother were going to sell the car at auction and he wanted to make sure it was alright.<br /><br />His wife was in town buying a rug for the new home when his daughter Joan came home from school to find her father lying unconscious by the side of the car in the garage.A verdict of Accidental Death was recorded at Birmingham Coroners Court.<br /><br /><br /><br />Biography kindly supplied by Mrs Joan M Jones, Ted Mellors daughter, Shirley, Solihull, Birmingham.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/188591f1e85ec56338d49e0da1ffa4e7.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c6c51f4cd150b04ec9749bfb937cbed5.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ae1e1f0e4f1f604f8c1aa60c256a1357.jpg,,,,1,1,2,2,0,5,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11

Aubs long, adventurous life was so rich and varied that it is difficult to know what to leave out, He was a boxer, a gymnast and an athlete; at the age of 15 he went to the opening of the Panama Canal to speak on behalf of the YAL; and his motorcycle and car racing careers spanned more than forty years. He turned to motorcycle competition when barely out of his teens, and he made such a name for himself as a talented, daredevil motorcyclist that he finished up in the UK in 1926, riding for the Sunbeam motorcycle firm. He was the first Australian to ride at the Isle of Man in the famous TT, and in the Ulster Grand Prix. <br /><br />Back in Australia Aub was instrumental in setting up the now-famous Harley Scramble, and was so good that he promptly won three out of the first four! A bad-racing accident in the late 1920s nearly severed his foot, and he faced the onset of the depression unemployed and on crutches, but overcame both of these obstacles and established his successful garage business. <br /><br />Aub Melrose was also keenly interested in cars, in particular the ubiquitous Austin 7, and in 1922 he was one of the prime movers in the foundation of the W A Car Club, which catered for those motor enthusiasts who wanted a milder, on-road form of motor sport rather than the all-out racing offered by the WASCC. This led him into car trials. <br /><br />In 1936 he and his wife Gwyn scored a major triumph when they drove their tiny 1921 Austin 7 across the Nullarbor, won the South Australian Centenary Trial against all comers, and then drove home again. This was not the first of his Nullarbor crossings  eventually; he crossed the desert no fewer than 52 times, including the first lone crossing by motorcycle. He was so convinced of the need for a proper road that in 1935 he led a delegation to Canberra to petition the Government on the matter. It wasnt until 1942 that the first actual road linked the East and the West (before then it had been a route rather than a road) and he was the first civilian to use it. Constructed by the army, it was known as the Military Road until later renamed the Eyre Highway. <br /><br />His damaged foot (and possibly his age  he was almost 40) kept him out of the Army when War broke out, so he served in a civilian capacity by instructing army dispatch riders in the techniques of rough riding. <br /><br />Aub actually started car racing in the 1930s, and from about 1937 entered most of the round-the-houses races  including the famous Patriotic Grand Prix  invariably in the valiant little Austin 7. The WASCC pretty well dissolved during the War years, but Aub was one of the enthusiasts instrumental in getting the Club going again and, in particular, staging the massively successful Victory Grand Prix at Caversham in 1946. <br /><br />The inevitable Austin 7 gave way to a variety of cars in the post-war years. He bought a damaged MG TD and built it up for the 1951 Australian Grand Prix; raced an Austin Healey 100M to second place in the 1956 six hour Race; competed in Round- Australia Trials in Austin A40, an Austin A70 and then an Austin A95; and in 1960 drove a Porsche to fourth outright in the Touring Car Championship and sixth outright in the Six Hour Race, at an age when most men are content merely to talk about such things. <br /><br />Over the years Aub Melrose occupied just about every position in both the WA Car Club and the WA Sporting Car Club, became Life Member of both, and was held in the greatest of esteem by all who knew him. In the early 1970s he suffered a series of strokes, which left him partly paralysed, and he could only move about, and talk with the greatest of difficulty. In his last years he was in and out of hospital, and he died on 18 November 1978, six days after his 78th birthday, but lives on in the memories of the many friends who will never forget him.<br /><br /><br /><br />Information kindly provided by Terry Walker<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/8764bf7d4e1887a67da214058ddcc066.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He was respected as a racer who was both fast and safe and he was one of the few competitive riders of the time who had come through two decades, covering the both four strokes and two strokes, which required quite different riding styles.<br /><br />His racing career began in 1952 when he was ""young and daft"". On a speedway JAP he was chasing champ Bill Innes on Forth Inch. In 1956 he turned to road racing on a 350 Gold Star BSA. In 1958 a Snaefell Newcomer's Race was held in the Isle of Man, in addition of the Manx GP. They only held it that one year for as Bill recalled ""there were lads going a&#8217; place, over dykes. the lot"". Bill managed to finish the race that year when Phil Read won, and so began his apprenticeship on the TT course.<br /><br />Although he was one of the top riders in Scotland during almost all his racing years, his heart was in riding the TT at the Isle of Man. He knew it so well he was able to show the quickest line through certain bends to men who went on to win the Manx. Selwyn Griffiths for instance didn't believe it possible to take a G50 Matchless through the Barrragarroo flat out in top gear. Bill showed him how to work up to it to such an effect that a spectator who saw the Milne Matchless approaching on full song fell backwards over a dyke!<br /><br />The year Jock Findlay from Bonnyrigg won the 500 Manx GP, Bill came third on a 350 AJS. It was against the rules to ride a 350 in the Senior, but Bill made it no secret that he was riding a 7R. After the race he was brought in front of a 14 man committee, the Chairman demanding an explanation. Bill said he had ""paid his money and wanted a canter"", ""Some canter,"" said a voice from the back. Bill however, agreed the rules were the rules and was duly disqualified. Some years later a peace offering came from the same committee in the form of an oil painting of himself airborne at Ballaugh Bridge on an Aermacchi Metisse.<br /><br />Over a racing lifetime, Bill rode many bikes including the G50 Matchless, Bultaco, Yamaha, R7, and his favourite a 500 Norton.<br /><br />Bill Milne died in 1987; he is much missed but never forgotten by his wife Rita, and daughters Katrina and Kerry.<br /><br />The main picture here shows Bill's medals, which his wife Rita says, ""Bill was very proud to wear"".

1811,Derek Minter,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=1811&filter=M,N,"<img class=""floatleft"" src=""/images/cache/951d596680c8bc43b5447a40273c39d9.jpg"" alt=""Photograph"" />Although primarily known for his success in the 1950s and 60s on Britain's short circuits, particularly Brands Hatch, Derek Minter was formidably impressive both on the Isle of Man and in the limited number of grands prix he undertook.  Among his many remarkable achievements was to become the first rider of a British single cylinder machine (Norton) to lap the island at over 100mph but he was not averse to giving the multi-cylinder bikes and their better paid riders a run for their money and even beating them.<br /><br />Throughout his career he was always prepared to say what he believed.  He never felt completely at home in a team situation.  His frankness may not have made him an automatic choice with the big-time factory team bosses but his great enthusiasm and love of the sport turned him into one of the most popular and finest riders of his time.<br /><br />Minter, the son a Kentish miner who himself loved motorcycles, was brought up in the village of Littlebourne, a few miles outside Canterbury, and knew from an early age that his biggest ambition was to buy a motorcycle (or ""bicycle"" as he always called his machines).  He spent weekends and holidays apple picking, with every penny going into his motorcycle fund.  After getting a job as an electrician's mate with the Canterbury Bus Company he raised  150 and, in 1948, at the age of sixteen he purchased a new 350cc BSA.  He quickly realised that riding on the roads was not a sufficient challenge.  He started riding in trials on his road bike.<br /><br />After National Service in the RAF he often became a fascinated spectator at Brands Hatch and took a job with Hallets, of Canterbury, the motorcycle dealers who were to become his sponsors.  The proprietor, Ray Hallet, had been a useful road race and grass track rider himself and had taken Derek to the Isle of Man to be his mechanic in the Manx Grand Prix. Eventually Minter persuaded the company to provide him with a BSA Gold Star.  Twice he entered his name for races at Brands Hatch and twice he backed out, suddenly realising that it took more bravery to turn up and race rather than watch.  Eventually he plucked up courage and began to show real talent.<br /><br />For a time his career flourished.  After five years riding for Hallets he was offered the chance to race some MV Agusta small capacity machines while continuing with his own Gold Star in 500cc events. The MVs were underpowered and his career seemed to being going nowhere.  Back in Canterbury, he became a taxi driver, often carrying inmates from Canterbury prison to other jails around the country.<br /><br />His chance to return to racing came when he found that the owners of a new local garage were keen on motorcycling.  They offered him a job as a mechanic and, more importantly, two Nortons.  He rode well at various domestic events and in 1957 was third in the 500cc Dutch Grand Prix and fourth in the 350cc race.  However, after a disagreement with the garage owners he decided to go freelance.<br /><br />At twenty-six he was a full-time professional rider, alone but determined.  With only 100 to his name, he entered the 1958 Isle of Man TT with his own Nortons.   He achieved a commendable fourth in the Senior race - while all the time praying that the bike would not suffer an expensive breakdown - and was placed ninth in the Junior. The island held a love-hate relationship for him.  He refused to believe that the cost of competing there and the risks involved made it worthwhile and, towards the end of his career, he decided against making the journey. <br /><br />Important to his success in the late fifties and sixties was his link with Steve Lancefield and Ray Petty, engineers who knew everything there was to know about the tuning of Manx Norton engines.<br /><br />The 1958 season at Brands Hatch also saw him sensationally beat John Surtees, who had previously been more or less unbeatable on the Kentish circuit and was riding his factory four-cylinder MV Agusta. The track was wet and the MV heavy but Minter was in such form that he may well have won even if the conditions had been more friendly to the Italian fire engine. Surtees had pulled in for a brief mechanical stop but at half-distance still got ahead of Minter who, typically, recovered to win.<br /><br />In the meantime he had shown his love of all forms of motorcycle sport by spending the winters trials riding.  But the road race season had begun with a crash at, of all places, Brands Hatch.  He recovered and made his first appearance at Oulton Park (which, surprisingly in view of his reputation at Brands, was to become his favourite circuit). He gave the great Bob McIntyre a real tussle in the 500cc event before finishing second.  <br /><br />His appearance in the 1959 TT was unhappy.  He retired in the 250cc race on his R.E.G. and decided to abandon the Senior event because the rain was so heavy he said it was impossible to continue.  Even so, his fame had spread abroad and MZ offered him a 125cc machine and Morini a 250.  He led for five laps before eventually finishing third in the Dutch Grand Prix on the Morini which he said was as fast as his 350cc Norton.  He raced in the Belgian and Italian Grands Prix without winning but always keeping in touch with the leaders.<br /><br />Throughout his career he fought against an inability to make quick, effective starts, yet in a way that was what contributed towards his popularity.  He would regularly still be push starting his bike while the others from the front row of the grid were well on their way to the first bend.<br /><br />He had always realised that racing on the home circuits in front of big crowds paid rather better than appearing against the factory-supported riders on the grand prix circuit.  Also, he believed, rightly, that his particular neat style was more suited to the tight, short circuits than the long ones on the Continent.  He never adopted the knee-out style made popular by one of his great rivals, John Cooper, and which, if truth be known, he probably despised.<br /><br />His visit to the Isle of Man in 1960 had been preceded by a taste of what he could achieve.  At the various Easter meetings he had entered nine races and won eight, with one second place.  The season brought one of his most memorable feats.  The Senior race on the island had, not unusually, been in doubt because of mist and low cloud over the mountain.  Indeed, that morning a group of his supporters from the Canterbury area organised by Ray Hallet, circled overhead in a trundling old Dakota waiting a gap in the cloud and convinced that if the race did start they would be too late to get there.  In fact we arrived and saw history in the making.  <br /><br />Minters 100mph lap, achieved shortly before Mike Hailwood did the same also on a Norton, suggested that he could even challenge Surtees, who was on the howling MV, but a split oil tank forced his retirement on the third lap.  Even so, the brief performance was all the more remarkable since he had almost recorded a 100mph average on his first lap from a standing start.  He had overtaken McIntyre at the thirty-third milestone and led him by two seconds back at the start line (a lap of 99.51mph).  Surtees won ahead of John Hartle (MV) and Hailwood.<br /><br />In 1961 he was British champion for the second time and 1962, his most successful year, he was the champion in Senior, Junior and 250cc classes.  Records fell to him almost at will and such was his dominance that on one occasion at Brands Hatch he won five races. His biggest win that season was the Mallory Park 1000 Guineas Race of the Year but probably the more remarkable success was to beat the factory Hondas (including that ridden by Jim Redman) to win the 250cc TT on a year-old non-works Honda. Indeed, 1962 was a year in which he seemed almost unbeatable and was justifiably named <i>Man of the Yea</i>r by readers of <i>Motor Cycle News.</i>   Riding the Honda four and a works 650cc Norton twin (in up to 1,000cc events), he had good machinery and took full advantage while still remaining loyal to his 500cc Petty tuned Manx Norton now once again sponsored by Hallets.<br /><br />His first race on the 250cc Honda four was at Brands Hatch where he won that class and the 500cc event.  In the up-to-1000cc race he was against Hailwood who took an early lead.  Minter overcame one of his traditional poor starts to get back on terms with the future champion and finally pass him to win.<br /><br />On the island the Honda he used was considered to be out of date yet he not only achieved his first TT victory but beat all of the official works riders. He and Redman exchanged the lead five times.  McIntyre had led by half a minute early on with Minter third, behind Redman, the world championship leader.  After McIntyre dropped out Redman took what looked like a race-winning lead but on the third lap Minter got by to win, though over the final miles he was convinced that there was a mechanical problem. <br /><br />When the mechanics stripped the bike down they found that the crankcase had been broken in three places.<br /><br />The 1962 season continued with records everywhere he went but the Honda management could never forgive him for that victory over their latest machinery. He hoped that Gilera might make an offer.  Although he had the occasional ride on the Italian bikes, that was as far as it went.<br /><br />After Surtees moved into car racing, Minter became even more popular.  Not surprisingly the Brands Hatch authorities realised that the unofficial King of Brands title was far too good not to be exploited.  Actually, it was the commentator Murray Walker who had previously dubbed Minter King of Brands and the phrase kept on being repeated until on Good Friday, 1965 the first official King of Brands event was held before a crowd of nearly 50,000.   Minter did not reserve himself for the one big race but won the 350cc event on his Norton. But in the 250cc race on the Cotton (a quick and responsive little machine) he made a familiarly poor start and finished only fourth behind the ever-brave and spectacular Bill Ivy.  However, the unofficial and long reigning King was not about to be deposed in the 500cc race.<br /><br />Unusually, he made a fast start and won at a speed of 86.09mph, beating the very fast Yamaha of Phil Read and the enormously powerful 850cc Dunstall Norton twin of Dave Degens.  Admittedly Ivy fell at Druids.  Read continued the chase but had to admit defeat to The Mint.  The following year Ivy got his revenge and in the year after that Minter was injured and so could not compete.  Indeed by then his career was almost finished.  He retired in 1967.  It was not only the end of his career but the conclusion of an era of unforgettable short circuit racing which he graced with skill, courage and downright stubbornness.   His love of the sport continued after retirement with appearances at classic racing bike events. <br /><br /> TT Record: 1957 Senior: 16th (Norton). Junior: 14th (Norton)1958 Senior: 4th (Norton).

So close was their friendship that in 1934 Johnny Duncan lent Donald Mitchell his 250cc works Cotton which was entered into the MGP lightweight class. He also lent Mitchell his leathers!. <br /><br />The 1934 lightweight was run together with the Junior race, which was won by none other than John (Crasher) White. Meanwhile back in the lightweight class it looked like an easy win for Bob Foster, later to become the 350cc world Champion, who led for most of the race but in the 6th lap, after some problems in the pits for Mitchell (sorted out by Johnny Duncan) he put in the fastest lap of the day (66.02mph) to pip Foster at the post by 34 seconds having started 40 seconds behind Foster. Mitchell became the first Scot to win a MGP race and the only rider to win on a Cotton. <br /><br />Other interesting facts regarding Donald Mitchell's success were that in 1934 Johnny Duncan was riding for New Imperial in the TT and when Duncan went to help Mitchell in the pits New Imperial were not too happy as places 2, 3 and 4 were taken by their riders also Mitchell only had sight in one eye having lost the sight in his left eye as a youngster. <br /><br />This was Donald Mitchell's first and only race on the Island as when he returned a triumphant hero to Aberdeen he was told by his Bank to choose between racing or banking  as they did not approve of his racing!! <br /><br />Nowadays the Banks would be treating their staff as heroes and offering them huge sponsorship for such success!!<br /><br /><br /><br />This profile has been submitted Graham Mitchell the son of W Donald Mitchell<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/3b8e25684320ecd6b6ce78fdf4d0fd3c.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

My success is dear to me because I've succeeded on my old motorcycle (Kawasaki ZXR 750) made in 1989. <br /><br />I've been riding in races for the past 10 years. Until 2000 I was performing in the class SBK, and I was vice-champioon the last three years in the Championship of Croatia. <br /><br />I started driving classic bike races in 1999. For the last 5 years I have been the champion of Croatia. <br /><br />My results for 2003 are: Champion of the Open Championship of Slovakia, third place in the Alpe-Adria Championship and the Champion of Croatia. <br /><br />All results have been achieved in the category of classic bike over 500ccm made before 1978.

In the second of the races the pair took 3rd place.1991 brought a D.N.F and further 3rd position, whilst 92 gave Dave and Karl Ellison sixth and third finishing positions.The same crew in 1993 achieved a double victory, whereas twelve months later with new chairman Pete Hill double second positions were gained, pipped to the post both times by Rob Fisher and Michael Wynn.Moly and Pete Hill were non-starters in the first race of 1995  the reason lack of time to prepare his outfit, due to excessive demand on his engineering skills requested by his rivals!They were on the grid for the second race, eventually taking second place once again to Fisher, this time with Boyd Hutchinson in the chair.1996 proved that Molyneux and Hill were becoming the new masters of the Snaefell Mountain Course, once again taking a double victory and increasing the race record to 110.28 mph as they took the chequered flag in the second race.Missing from the TT in 1997, 1998 proved to be an unusual year, as the first side race was abandoned without an engine being fired in anger, due to the weather.With Doug Jewell as ballast in less than ideal conditions, they powered their Honda supported outfit to the number one spot on the podium in the second race.1999 saw Craig Hallam as passenger, winning the first of the two races at record speed [111.90 mph] and setting a new lap record at 112.76 mph.Dave and Craig were out of luck in the second race, retiring from the action, but not before once again setting the fastest lap of the race at 112.41 mph, marginally below the outright lap record.Missing in 2000, as Dave and Karl Ellison entered the world championships, Molyneux was due to once again challenge the rigours of the Mountain Course  although all the effort was to no avail, the 2001 races being cancelled due to the foot and mount epidemic. <br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/07ddcf0d542793327240c8b3b0335baf.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/cd3c24f7d4d1dd84944320293ba19abb.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c6783140bd1d901b11569258edf0d3fb.jpg,,,,16,6,3,1,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11

During 1949 they travelled together in Europe, and generally amazed people on the Isle of Man and across Europe.<br /><br />Morrison and Hinton staged a dead-heat in a race at Gedinne in Belgium. It was George''''s idea. He told Harry that if they played smart, they could both collect first prize money. ""We still had a lot of fun, and the result gave us good drawing power George said.<br /><br />George Morrison was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1912 and completed an apprenticeship as a motor mechanic with the Vacuum (Mobil) Oil Company. He caught the racing bug in 1932-1933, while on assignment for Vacuum in Adelaide, South Australia. George helped a local motorcycle dealer prepare test machines for beach racing. He couldn''''t afford to road-race, because a gallon of methanol racing fuel cost the equivalent of a weeks pay, so he bought a Douglas motorcycle in 1934 and, went grass-track racing. After winning a few races, George bought a Velocette 250 and switched to scrambles racing, winning 46 events.<br /><br />Morrison moved to Ballarat, Victoria, in 1936 and opened a motorcycle dealership. The first road races held in Victoria after the war were at Victoria Park, Ballarat. Here Morrison became friends with visiting Sydney rider Harry Hinton. George was not ed for the 1949 Australian Isle of Man team, but his international performances that summer soon made a mockery of that non-ion. In 1949 George travelled as a private entrant.<br /><br />Morrison and Hinton created an immediate impression on the Isle of Man. Other riders pussyfooted over the first-gear jump at Ballaugh Bridge and through the right-hand corner that follows. Harry and George took the jump with a rush, sending both wheels well off the ground, and almost brushed the wall with their handlebars as they took the right-hander. ""They all thought I was mad George said. He finished 27th in the 350 TT. In the 500 TT he won plaudits for his riding and his tenacity. ""Halfway around the Isle of Man course there''''s a village called Kirk Michael. The corner coming into the town is a long, sweeping bend, which we could take at about 90 mph. On the outside of the corner, was a footpath, about three feet wide, then a low stonewall. During the races people would sit along the wall.<br /><br />""British roads have low-melting point tar, so it won''''t crack during the winter. The temperature that day was up around 90 on the old scale, and so, unknown to me, the tar started to melt. <br /><br />""The first time through Kirk Michael, my bike started to creep across the road. I couldnt work out why. The next thing the bike hit the gutter on the outside of the corner and bounced up onto the footpath. Fortunately, the footpath was concrete, so I had some grip. I didnt back off! There were about 40 spectators sitting along the top of the wall, with their legs dangling in front. <br /><br />""When I took off down the footpath, the blokes and ladies just flopped backwards over the wall to miss my handlebars. There were legs and bloomers everywhere. I rode the footpath until I was lined up for the next corner, then aimed back into the middle of the road and waved back to say thanks for getting their legs out of the way. The Poms thought I was Superman to do that and not back off!<br /><br />Morrison moved into top-six contention in the next six laps. He was duelling with New Zealander Sid Jensen (Triumph). But Georges Norton was literally falling apart underneath him, the frame broken in five places. Eight kilometres from the finish, the float bowl of his carburettor vibrated off the bike. He pushed and coasted the last 8 km and still finished 31st. <br /><br />Morrison returned to the Isle of Man in 1950 as a ed Australian team member. Norton hired Morrison and Hinton for the TT, as members of the ""B-team"", with Londoner Harold Daniell. Morrison pushed home 64th in the 350 TT, after his drive chain broke, and finished 11th, one place behind Hinton, in the 500 TT.<br /><br />Morrison opened his 1950 European season by winning a 500 international race at Zaandvoort. He followed that up with 14th place in the Belgian 350 GP. McPherson was eighth and Hinton 11th. Morrison made an indifferent start in the Dutch 350 TT. He was running about 20th and trying to improve his position when he crashed. The injuries sustained finished his season prematurely.<br /><br />Morrison then headed home to Australia, via America. ""While I was in San Francisco, I met a bloke whod read about my exploits in Europe and wanted to sponsor me. In 1952 this bloke paid my expenses to go back to America and ride his Manx Norton at Daytona, where the track was half beach and half road.<br /><br />""But the Yanks were cunning. The AMA (American Motorcyclist Association) wanted an American to win Daytona on a Harley-Davidson or an Indian. They said I would have to do a Novice race and a Junior race before I could have an Expert licence and ride at Daytona. I won a Novice race at Stockton, California and a Junior race at Dodge City, Kansas. But my three-month entry visa ran out before the Daytona race: he lamented.<br /><br />Compared with many later Australian travellers they were almost gentlemen racers. They lived in hotels. If Harry or George had a breakdown during practice, the other would lend him his machine to ensure he qualified. You have to be good mates to lend someone your bike at the expense of your own practice time on a new circuit.<br /><br />Both Harry and George were in their late thirties and both mechanically gifted, They needed to be, because the Manx Norton Garden Gate frames broke as fast as Hinton, Morrison and the staff back in Bracebridge Street could repair them. The rule of thumb was that if the machine stopped vibrating, then the frame had broken.<br /><br />Norton was so impressed with the pairs efforts it offered them works machines (a 350 for Hinton and a 500 for Morrison) for the second-biggest motorcycle race in the British Isles, the Ulster Grand Prix.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Australian Motorcycle Heroes 1949  1989</i>.Don Wilcox &amp; Wil HagonAngus &amp; RobertsonISBN 0 207 16207 7<br /><br /><br /><br />Information sent by Tony Morrison  2004<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/6cbd70cb084ae760b711539713442d18.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7512905e691c63bc0c2b6af6e15b2b9e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/33b9e822a6d6219c1651c50b47609e31.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whilst at university (Trinity College, Dublin) to read Geology, he joined the DUMC&LCC; (Dublin University Motor Cycle and Light Car Club) and started competing on his home-tuned 500cc Triumph. <br /><br />His first event was the club hill climb at Cruagh (the Gaelic word for hard!) in the Dublin Mountains in 1964.  This was an event not to be missed in following years, and he invariably took the award for fastest club member, and frequently put up fastest time of the day.   During one of the early events, Fred crashed into a gateway and from that year onwards the gate was left open in case a further attempt was made!   From this and other exploits he earned the title Fearless Fred!!!<br /><br />Every spare penny from his employment in Guinnesss brewery was spent making his home-tuned machinery, mostly big Triumph and Norton based twins, go faster.  The number of events he attended rapidly expanded and soon he was travelling to most of the main Irish national road races both north and south of the border.  He also entered hill-climbs and sprints whenever possible, and even a few trials in the winter months. When sprint racing became popular, he also built a kneeler on a Triumph frame, though he lacked the resources to take this to the ultimate in performance.   He was renowned for his dedication and enthusiasm, and was rewarded with many fine performances on the road. <br /><br />In 1979, his competition career entered a new phase when he attempted the Manx Grand Prix for the first time.  He was over the moon (in his own words!) when he managed to lap at over 91 mph on a 500cc Norton twin in practice.  He finished the race at an average speed of over 76 mph, despite the poor conditions.<br /><br />He returned to the Island in 1981 on the Triumph (DNF), and in 1983 and 1984, entered the Classic Junior race on a 350ccAermacchi.  In his final appearance, he finished a very creditable 5th at an average speed of over 88 mph.<br /><br />In the same years, he was one of the moving spirits in the foundation of the Irish Classic Racing Association, and in 1987 became the Irish Classic Champion in the unlimited class.<br /><br />Sadly, Fred died in August 1988 whilst on holiday in Co. Donegal  ironically, he suffered a heart attack whilst sailing a Laser dingy, and drowned before help could reach him.  Dozens of his comrades in motorcycling travelled to attend his funeral in Co. Dublin, a fitting testament to the high regard in which he was held.  <br /><br />To those who had the privilege to know him, he will always be remembered as a true enthusiast and a worthy member of the sport, which he loved so much.  Who knows what he could have achieved if he had not been taken so early ... <br /><br /><br /><br />This simple biography is dedicated to his memory.<br /><br /><br /><br />MWB   JMF   MDB<br /><br />October 2005<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/587ccbef00f080d3689e208396d29ef6.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/0cc92c2294aea20f8d6892e3debc5001.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e37af4c8833cac270fdc5829c9f40445.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

His first excursion in 1970 was one of mixed fortunes, starting with a retirement in the 750cc race and finishing 36th in the 500cc race.Missing in 1971, the Hemel Hempstead driver rode in both sidecar races from 72 onwards with varying degrees of success. Runner-up in the 500cc class in 1974 he was totally out of luck throughout 1975 &amp; 1976.In 1977 the two separate class races were combined into two-legs with an overall winner based on the aggregate time of the finishers.George and passenger, Kenny Arthur unofficially set the first 100mph sidecar lap in practice, although Dick Greasley set the official one in the first race at 100.59 mph.Even so, it was to be ODell and Arthurs race as they took the chequered flag by 50 seconds as they raised the lap record to 102.80 mph.Retirement in the second race prevented them from taking overall victory.ODell was to go on to become the first Briton to win the Sidecar championship since Eric Oliver, some 24 years earlier.A crash in practice for the 1978 TT, resulting in a broken leg meant he was a non-starter and did not return to the Island.At the beginning of 1981 he was advised to retire from racing  in March of that year he died in a house fire, aged 35.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e44f9dfb14176361fd4c1c99e2707bf7.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/0de5d200c7defba750668a6b9edfc43e.jpg,,,,,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8

He went on to win 3 further world championships in 1950, 1951 and 1953.<br /><br />In 1954 when sidecars returned to the TT for the first time since 1925, on the newly introduced 10.79 mile Clypse Course, Eric with passenger Les Nutt they entered the record books by becoming the first sidecars winners on the new course creating lap and race records in the process.<br /><br />There was to be no fairy-tale repeat of their 1954 victory, the following year, as the Norton outfit succumbed to the might of the BMW competition.Eric retired from Grand Prix racing to open a motorcycle shop in Staines, Middlesex.Never losing enthusiasm or interest, he returned to the Isle of Man in 1958, to compete in the Sidecar TT, on a standard production Norton Dominator twin fitted with a Watsonian chair, with Mrs. Pat Wise as the intrepid passenger. Neither was disgraced as they provided perhaps the spectacular racing during the 10-lap race taking the chequered flag in tenth position, collecting a Bronze Replica for their efforts.<br /><br />The TT organisers were contemplating moving all the races to the Mountain Course, so in 1959, Eric and his passenger Stan Dibben, were asked to proceed the roads-open car on a lap of the 37.73 mile course at the conclusion of the Senior TT of 1959, to see if the chairs could cope with the course!<br /><br />All was satisfied, and the 1960 TT saw Eric and Stan entered for the three-lap race. However, a dramatic accident during practice when the bolt holding the forks sheared put them out of contention. Eric broke his back in two places and Stan came close to be decapitated as the outfit plunged off the circuit heading straight for a wire fence. Luckily the sidecar broke the wire fence as it came into contact with Stan's throat and he was thrown clear. Eric recovered fully from his injuries and Stan was not seriously hurt.

Francis Beart, the chief Norton tuner, saw my bike,patted me on the head and advised me to go home. I started in one race -finished but fell off in the other. Nortons'' did give me a new carb.<br /><br />1939 -WW2 -Commissioned  into the Royal Armoured Corps - served against the Japanese  and on returning home was posted to Blandford Forum in 1947 in charge of National Service Driver Training<br /><br />I saw the possibilities of the internal camp road as a race track and incooperation with The Blackmore Vale Motorcycle Club I prevailed upon theArmy Authorities to allow us to race. The first and subsequent races wereall supported by all the works teams. I had a Tiger 100 and that had to beraced and I had quite a few races at Blandford.<br /><br />I decided I was a potential TT winner and entered the 1948 Clubman''s race and won an entry to the Manx Grand Prix that year. I crashed at Laurel Bank on a patch of oil from a previous accident - remounted but crashed  again later at Ramsey and retired.<br /><br />1949 - acquired a 7R AJS. Racer for the 1949 Manx but the 3rd gear went -I finished, but well down.<br /><br />1949 - Posted all over the world after that and never had the opportunity torace again. I managed to see the 1953 TT. Bob Foster who I had racedagainst and knew well at Blandford I think was killed in the Senior. <br /><br />I visited the Isle of Man a few years later playing golf but made sure it coincided with TT week. <br /><br />My interest these days is watching Superbikes and wondering how they manage to stay on. <br /><br />If it is of interest I have my own Web Site -WWW.neil-osborne.co.uk<br /><br /><br /><br />Regards<br /><br />Neil Osborne<br /><br />",,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However in 1957, and against the advice of his friends he decided to take up sports car racing, starting at the bottom again, he became very successful. He brought a Lotus in kit form and with the aid of his mechanic Mac Mc Donald they built the car in three weeks. This car was capable of 120mph.<br /><br />After three races, Eric decided to try his hand at a big race in Denmark. The 7cwt car was shipped to the track at Copenhagen in his furniture van.<br /><br />Eric raced against 20 high-class continental and English drivers, and then roared home in first place to win the 1960 Copenhagen Cup.<br /><br />He was s proud of his win and said it was a huge thrill doing the ""Lap of Honour"" and receiving the be-ribboned laurel garland &amp; cup.<br /><br />Weeks later he was tragically killed in a collision with an army lorry at Knapp Hill Woking. He only wore a helmet when racing.<br /><br />His many friends who came to his funeral all said he was the finest gentleman they had known on and off the track- and I have to agree- he was in every meaning of the word.<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Told by Vera Gallantry</i>",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/7455132f18a1e19f854200bda932c17b.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/35f5dce34e8d04ab9da8cb622a8d4ec8.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d1fbd0c3fd3dff414a160a68545c02c1.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

2325,Renzo Pasolini,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=2325&filter=P,N,"<img class=""floatleft"" src=""/images/cache/1c3a75412585d8788d30c8440b2f38a0.jpg"" alt=""Photograph"" />Renzo Pasolini TranslationRenzo Pasolini was made for the pure pleasure of bike fans. He was one of those men that love to give everything, he wasn't conservative: every race contested seemed to be the most important one for him. When he was racing he didn't think to the future or to the championship, but was thinking only about approaching the next bend in the best way possible or the next straight. He was racing, gaining an incredible balance in every moment, so close to the limit and was so amazing to watch on the bike. But with this kind of philosophy - he wanted ""everything immediately"" - ""Paso"" (this was his typical nickname) lost the 1969 Championship of the World in the 250 class with the Benelli. In this year Kel Carruthers was ""Paso's substitute, after the Italian rider suffered two bad crashes. And at the end of the year, Kel won the 250 cc title...<br /><br />Watching Pasolini racing, the crowd experienced two feelings: from a certain point of view, he gave a lot of pleasure through all the spectacular things that he was able to show, but also there was the fear of a possible crash. Pasolini in the Sixties was the master of road racing in Italy, on the street circuits of the cities in front of the Adriatic Sea, like Rimini, Riccione, Milano Marittima and Cesenatico, special places in which every spring, some races called ""Temporada Adriatica"" took place. In this environment ""Paso"" was able to reach the peak of his skill: his particular style consisted of a good background as a motocross rider, so sensitive, and he was able to use the throttle as he was mastering the tight road racing circuits of the Adriatic. Even though Renzo was giving 100% at every moment, it is interesting to point out that in all his career he fell off only few times (but, sadly, in very important moments, like during 1969 obviously) and his fatal crash (Monza 1973) was probably due to a seized engine. <br /><br />Even though, to tell the truth, lots of people in Italy are still not thinking this way: they are thinking that there was oil on the tarmac and this should be the cause of the last Paso Crash.<br /><br />Pasolini was also a very enjoyable kind of person and he had a very good sense of humour. Lots of times he was able to make his fans laugh, especially during the interviews on the Italian TV channels, when Renzo used his humour against his typical rival: Giacomo Agostini.<br /><br />He had a lot of power and strength in his hands; he was not too tall or too short. His eyesight was not so perfect and he had to use glasses. And not only on the bike... When he was little more than a boy, he tried boxing and then motocross. Renzo said that if he had not been a bike rider; he'd have been a good puncher! But even though Pasolini was a very good sportsman, his behaviour was not so perfect: he loved smoking and also spending the night enjoying eating and drinking with his friends... Renzo Pasolini was born in Rimini (close to the Adriatic Sea) on 18th July 1938. His father Massimo was himself a bike rider and himself, broke some class world speed records in his career. <br /><br />The first racing experience of ""Paso"" took place when he was twenty years old in motocross. From that point on he loved motocross and was using motocross bikes every winter, throughout his career, to keep him fit.<br /><br />In 1962 he began road racing with an Aermacchi 175 cc and was immediately able to beat a very young and sensational rider called Giacomo Agostini two times. This was a typical sign of the destiny. The struggle with Mino ended only in 1973, the year of the Pasos fatal crash at Monza: 12 seasons later...<br /><br />In 1963, when he was 25 years old, ""Paso"" had to go into the Italian Army Service and went to the Isle of Sardinia (south of Italy). This was not a fantastic moment for his career, he was not able to race, because he had no time to do it, but he met Anna, the girl that would later become his wife. Anna, some years later, gave Renzo two babies: Sabrina and Renzo Stefano. (when Renzo died at Monza in 1973 Sabrina was 6 years old and Renzo Stefano only 2 1/2 years old).<br /><br />In 1964 Renzo came back to racing in the ""Senior"" class in Italy, at this time, was the class of the most experienced riders. He raced in the middle class with Aermacchi singles 250 cc and 350 cc: the problem for him was the lack of engine power, but sometimes he was able to beat more powerful machines, thanks only to his riding skill. In 1965 he was second with the Benelli, behind the famous Provini in the 250 cc Italian Championship and was third in the 350 national Championship, just behind Giacomo Agostini and Giuseppe Mandolini. <br /><br />With the Benelli team, together with the veteran, Gilberto Milani, he also contested some races in the World Championship: he was 4th at the Nurburgring and at the Dutch TT. He was also in the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy, but not with a lot of luck: he retired in both races: 250 and 350. <br /><br />In 1966 his best results in Italy were all in pure road races: second place at Milano Marittima 250cc, second at Cesenatico in the 500cc class (with a 350cc bike) and two third places in the 250 and 350cc class at Ospedaletti. <br /><br />In the World Championship he was fourth or fifth in 350 classes, but the best achievement was a place on the podium (third) in The Netherlands, alongside two legends, Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini. At the end of the season, the Benelli factory decided to give him the new 500cc bike (four cylinders). With his bike ""Paso"" immediately scored a victory in an Italian race, in front of the old Gilera of Remo Venturi.<br /><br />1967 was the hottest time of his duels with Ago that drove the Italian crowd crazy for so many years. Giacomo Agostini with MV Agusta against Renzo Pasolini with a Benelli: it appeared to be the title of a fantastic movie with a lot of thrilling sequences and never ending sequels! But the duels all took place, in Italy. Mainly because the Benelli factory did not have the will (or the money) to race abroad in every race of World Championship. Regardless, when ""Paso"" was racing, the results spoke for him: in the World Championship Renzo was third at Hockenheim and Assen with the 350cc bike (both times behind Hailwood and Agostini). In Italy the emotions were growing and growing every time: at Modena ""Paso"" won (Ago retired), and was second behind the MV Agusta at Riccione and Milano Marittima. Renzo won the 350cc race at Cesenatico in front of Ago, and was second at Imola and third at Zingonia, both times in the 350cc class. To these results we have to add two victories (even though Ago was not in either race) with the 250cc Benelli at Milano Marittima and with the 500cc bike at Pergusa. <br /><br />In 1968, Pasolini and the Benelli only beat Ago and his MV Agusta twice in Italy, at Cesenatico and Imola, but achieved second place eight times in Italy and abroad. The power of the MV was unbeatable. ""Paso"" did have good victories in the 250cc class at Rimini and, at the end of the season, in the 250 cc and 350cc Italian Championships.<br /><br />1969 seemed to be the beginning of a fantastic season for Pasolini, because he started the year with an incredible sequence of victories: Rimini 250cc and 350cc (with Ago second in this race), Modena 250 and 350cc (with Ago retired), Riccione 250 and 350cc (with Ago second in this race) and Riccione 250 and 350cc (Ago second) and Imola 250 and 350cc (Ago each time second - and rather angry - in the 350 class)! Then came the races at Cesenatico, when ""Paso"" won the 250cc race and came second, behind Agostini, in the 350cc race. <br /><br />But Milano Marittima was to be ""Paso's"" vengeance: two victories in 250 and 350cc races, with Agostini retired. The competition between Paso and Ago was incredible: in Italy the bike enthusiasts were divided into two parties: Paso's fans and Ago's fans.<br /><br />And not only was every race a step forward for the duel, every interview in the newspapers and every presence on TV shows gave the chance for some more battles of words and humour. Then a final showdown between Paso and Ago, to decide (obviously, with a lot of money for the winner) who is the best rider. <br /><br />The idea, to be honest, was very interesting but the Italian federation and also Benelli and MV Agusta were not happy about it, because it could be very dangerous. In the end, the challenge was forbidden by the FMI (Italian Federation). <br /><br />1969 was also the year in which Pasolini was closest to achieving his ultimate career goal: winning a World Championship. He was in a very good position in the 250cc class, but at Hockenheim fell off during practices and was not able to race. And for physical problems, he had to withdraw to race at the Tourist Trophy and Le Mans races. <br /><br />So Kel Carruthers took his place. The come back of Pasolini was in the Dutch TT at Assen and Renzo won the race in front of Carruthers and the Spanish Santiago Herrero (Ossa). But there was a bad surprise for Renzo at the Belgian GP of Spa Francorchamps: his engine broke and he was out of the race. Then came two more victories for Pasolini, at Sachsenring and Brno, in-front of Herrero and Gould. <br /><br />At Imatra, during the Finnish GP, another bad crash put Renzo out of contention for the Championship. At the end of the season the winner was the very lucky and, above all, conservative, Kel Carruthers... <br /><br />The only pleasure for the very sad Pasolini was the victory in two Italian Championships, 250cc and 350cc, not much of a consolation at the end of the day... <br /><br />For the 1970 season there were some new technical rules: it was no longer possible to race in the 250cc class with a four cylinder engine, so Pasolini and the Benelli preferred to race in the 350cc class. With his bike, ""Paso"" won at Rimini and Riccione (not World Championship races). <br /><br />In the World Championship, his best results were second places at Assen, Sachsenring and Brno, every time behind Giacomo Agostini on the MV Agusta. In the ""GP delle Nazioni"" Renzo Pasolini had to retire his Benelli 500 after setting a new lap record at 203 kph. <br /><br />But during the season the relationship between Pasolini and the Benelli factory deteriorated and got worse. This was because the rider felt that the bike was still not so competitive and, at the same time, the opinion of the factory was... the contrary. So it was not possible to avoid a sad divorce between Benelli and Pasolini. <br /><br />The Italian rider decided to come back to his first love: the Aermacchi. In the meantime, the factory had changed is name, and was now called Harley Davidson. The new, and very interesting bike at the factory was a 250cc two cylinder that needed a lot of testing to became competitive: not a problem! <br /><br />Renzo Pasolini, as ever, was ready to do the hard work!  But the task was not so easy: the 1971 season was lost with a bike that wasnt reliable. <br /><br />For 1972 there was something new and positive on the horizon: finally the 250cc HD of Gilberto Milani and Mr. Mascheroni was competitive, and for Paso the glory was to return. He won the Nazioni GP at Imola, also in Yugoslavia (Abbazia) and Spain (Barcelona); he came second at Clermont Ferrand (behind Phil Read), at Assen (behind Gould), at Sachsenring and Brno (behind Saarinen). <br /><br />In the national races in Italy, he won at Riccione and Ospedaletti, winning also his fifth Italian title. Results were also good in the 350cc class: he was second at Imola, Sachsenring, Brno and Barcelona. <br /><br />At the end of the season, in the World Championship, Renzo Pasolini was second in 250cc class and third in 350cc class: well done! <br /><br />During 1972 ""Paso"" raced in the USA at Ontario Race Park with a 750cc Harley Davidson: he was third at the end of the race, and best factory rider. <br /><br />In 1973 he tried to race in the ""Daytona 200"" with the 750 Harley, but with no luck. Regardless it was to be a very good season for Renzo. The HD had two new bike models, including a very competitive, two-cylinder water-cooled model. It is then, not surprising when, at the beginning of the racing year, ""Paso"" won at Riccione and Vallelunga (near Rome) and he also immediately won the Italian Championship (his sixth).<br /><br />But the fatal date was waiting for him at Monza, the 20th of May 1973. After an amazing race in the 350cc class, in which Pasolini was challenging for victory with Ago, his engine seized. <br /><br />Just after this unlucky race, Pasolini was due to start in the 250cc class, against the very competitive team Yamaha, with Jarno Saarinen as best rider. At the very first fast bend, ""il Curvone"", after a few hundred metres from the start, Pasolini fell off, and lots of riders followed him in a multiple and terrible crash: Saarinen, Walter Villa, Giansanti, Palomo, Kanaya, Mortimer and Jansson. <br /><br />For Pasolini and Saarinen death was instantaneous. All the Italian bike fans cried, including Ago's fans and Ago himself, for the loss of Renzo Pasolini.<br /><br />But this is not the right way and not the appropriate mood to remember the fantastic rider, Renzo Pasolini. It is better to remember him on his bike, with his eyes looking for the next bend and the throttle flat out as he loved to do throughout his entire career, and his life.<br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks to Mario Donnini for the translation to English.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/1c3a75412585d8788d30c8440b2f38a0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/990676316b8c9a37f097423f3d2122be.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c0acf8625805a37d6a10575bd4bb5993.jpg,,,,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

Throughout 1978 I also had the odd passenger outing in Mike Salmons Imp powered sidecar.  <br /><br />The Harris TZ was retained for 1979 with the Manx being the high point of the season.  <br /><br />Whilst the intention was to continue racing in 1980 and revisit the Manx, my plans were curtailed by the thief who purloined both my van and the TZ shortly after the Manx and brought forward my retirement plans.  <br /><br />I have retained my interest in road racing by assisting F1 sidecar driver Mike Salmon and his passengers as mechanic since 1991.  <br /><br />The team has raced at the Southern 100 (3 times until the rule changes forced out F1 sidecars) and at many International meetings throughout Europe. <br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks to Alan Pearson for contributing the above information.<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/ea3ceb1d0dbb8d153f964882b406b43e.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On leaving school in 1934 (his headmistress wanted him to become a schoolmaster) he became an apprentice at a local garage, served five years, then got into aircraft engineering.  He had his share of the drawing office, but soon organised it so that he was on the experimental side. Although he was no mean performer with protractor and dividers he preferred to get to grips with the machinery, as it were.<br /><br />What finer engineering exercise than ones own motorcycle. When fourteen, Ray bought his first machine, a 250cc Red Panther for fifty shillings (2.50). Like all first, cheap bicycles it provided lots of fun and an incredible inside knowledge of internal combustion engines. Ive been learning about them ever since.<br /><br />By 1939, at the age of nineteen the youthful Petty wanted to put his knowledge and skill to the test. Racing was the obvious course (he had already had a go at cycle grass-track racing with success) and a 250cc New Imperial was purchased and raced at Brooklands. Little did he know when he bought the Imp that he was to retain it for more than twelve years and to score with it a fifth place in the 1948 Lightweight TT.<br /><br />War found him in the experimental department of Vickers-Armstrongs at Weybridge where he, strangely enough, really got to know Francis Beart. Ray would set up the instruments, and Francis would test-run the Bristol engines. Only a few yards away from the track, which they both loved so well, it is not difficult to imagine in which direction their conversation, drifted.<br /><br />When the war ended Ray decided that motorcycles meant more to him than aeroplanes, and in 1946 he joined Francis Beart as his assistant at Byfleet, where the great man had set up shop. He stayed for nine years and in spite of working the usual long hours that seem inevitable in preparing racing machinery, he managed to prepare his own racing and trials bikes.<br /><br />Just to have coped with the preparation of the machines would have been enough for most people, but when his successes are recorded, the whole thing seems almost fantastic. Right up until 1953 which was he his last real competition year he was riding in road races, sprints and trials. The success list makes a really mixed but mighty impressive bag: 2nd class award in the Bob Kingsley Memorial Trial a win and fastest lap in the Blackmore Vale races at Blandford seventh in the Lightweight TT (Bronze Replica) first in the 500cc class of the North East London Sprints, and first in the 500cc class of the Vintage MCC Sprints at Thruxton.<br /><br />Pressure of work had made 1953 less race-packed than the previous years, some of which promote boggling when presented in awards gained form. Take 1948 for instance: A first-class award in the Victory Trial first-class in the Cotswold Cup Trial, 5th place in the Lightweight TT 2nd (350cc class) in the Waterlooville MCCs hill climb a first-class award in the Southern Centre Team Trial, and 14th place with a replica in the Hutchinson 100 are just a few of his successes.<br /><br />His weight of little more than nine stone made him a natural for lightweight machines, and with his special 250cc Nortons he had a chance of combining his tuning skill with his lack of <i>avoirdupois</i>. He ran the faithful old Imp until 1951 (in which year it netted him a 2nd at Blandford and a 3rd at Castle Combe) then decided to build his first 250cc Norton.  The Imp had served him well but the old pushrod engine, designed nearly twenty years earlier was not capable of keeping up with the continental racers.<br /><br />The Norton engine with its twin overhead camshaft layout at least offered power, even if weighty when compared with the continentals.<br /><br />First engine was devised with respective bore and stroke dimensions of 64 and 77 mm. Although some of the critics yelled long-stroke, it went fast, produced plenty of power, and as Ray sagely remarked It revved quickly enough to put it on the limit as far as the valve gear was concerned. This engine provided him (in conjunction with a feather-bed frame of course) with an 8th in the Lightweight TT (bronze replica), a 3rd at Blandford and a 4th and a 5th at Boreham.<br /><br />The 1952 TT performance was put up without any kind of fairing but by 1954 the 250cc Petty-Norton had a faired steering-head and engine, and was capable of 103 mph on the level. By that time a new Norton engine had been devised with bore and stroke of 65 mm and 75 mm respectively which would run up to 8000 rpm. On the downhill sections of the TT circuit like Bray Hill this meant speeds of about 112 mph. On 80 octane fuel, (  1 compression ratio and only partial streamlining it was  a remarkable performance. He finished 9th in 1954 at 76.36 mph.<br /><br />Typical of Rays analytical mind is the average speed sheet from his 1952 250cc record book. It shows 462 miles covered in six race meetings  at an average speed of 75.32 mph!<br /><br />Many sprint successes are to be found in Pettys score-book, and like Beart he confesses a great liking for this type of competition. His 500cc single-knocker rigid frame sprint Norton that he has had for many years is still in his possession, and if he can find just a little time in 1958 he intends to have the odd go, just to keep my hand in.<br /><br />It is certainly going to be difficult for him to find time. On my visit to the Petty establishment, it was so stacked out with work and bicycles as to make entry a major operation.<br /><br />Since setting up his own workshop in 1955 he has amassed many customers both for engine and complete machine preparation. He works exclusively on Nortons, a <i>marque</i> he knows intimately.<br /><br />His system of preparation is one of accurate fitting and careful assembly, using in the main, standard Norton racing components. Although he is prepared to try out experimental parts on his own machines, he is of the opinion that the most realistic and economic arrangement for racing men who are in the business is for their engines to be overhauled and rebuilt with Norton parts.<br /><br />It is one thing Ray says, to try out revolutionary ideas on ones own machinery, but if a private-entry, for instance, wants to go through a seasons racing reliably, and keep in the money, he is far better off with a carefully assembled racing engine, composed of standard parts. He has the highest regards for Norton bits. Theyve been in the racing business for so long they must have learned how to make engines.<br /><br />Applying this system he had a very good 1957 season. He prepared engines for Messrs. Tanner, Perris, Lewis and Clarke, and complete machines for Drysdale and Lewis. It is almost unnecessary to record some of these riders successes, but Tanners performances alone make interesting reading.<br /><br />With his 7th place in the Junior TT he was the second Norton to finish, averaged 90.25 mph, and his fastest lap was 91.57 mph. He was holding 4th place in the Senior but ran out of fuel on the 8th lap. His fastest lap was 96.25 mph.<br /><br />In the Swedish Grand Prix Clarke took 4th place in the Junior and was the first Norton home. These arte of course only a few picked at random out of the Petty record book, but they indicate the effectiveness of the preparation.<br /><br />When it comes to experimental work Ray is equally adept, his speciality being the building of 250cc racing engines based on the Norton unit. He has made several of these engines and is at present working on a new one with a one-piece crankshaft. He produces all his own working drawings, and the whole operation, with the exception of any heavy machining is carried out in his small workshop in Cove, near Farnborough, Hants. His No. 1 helper/secretary is Mrs Peggy Petty and between them they are building a solid and satisfying business.<br /><br />When questioned on his tuning methods, Ray re-iterated his previous remarks regarding careful assembly and new Norton parts, and opined that he hadnt a great deal of time for mirror-finish, port polishing and the like. He pins more faith on meticulous attention to ignition and valve timing, and to compression ratios suitable for the job in hand.<br /><br />Ray has carried out a mass of research on compression ratios. So many riders are apt to favour an engine set-up to, say 10 : 1, little realising that after a lengthy race carbon deposit has raised it to about 10.8 : 1, in all probability lowering the efficiency of the unit. It is such thought and attention to detail that produces real results.<br /><br />The Petty emporium can hardly be described as vast, in fact space is very much at a premium, but work proceeds in a very orderly manner. Two centre lathes and a drilling machine are squeezed into the confined workshop, not o mention an incredible number of frames, engines, exhaust pipes, and so on.<br /><br />A line of Nortons wait outside (under cover) for attention, amongst them Rays sprint machine. There are spares everywhere, even one room in the nearby house is given over to Norton items  several pounds worth!<br /><br />Somehow or other in the midst of all this activity he finds time to prepare special Norton car engines. One of his 250cc engines powered a specially streamlined Cooper which last year broke five world records at Monthlery. Amongst them was the 100 miles record at an average speed of 96.184 mph. During practice runs the car was lapping at more than 103 mph, but eventually bent a valve. Ray feels certain that his car was the first 250cc machine to exceed 100 mph.<br /><br />Ray built a 500cc racing car to his own design in 1956 which was racing with great success under his <i>aegis</i> until last season. It has now been sold, as bicycle and engine commitments are heavy, and time is limited.

He finished 27th, the race being won by Mike Hailwood on the works Honda 6. <br /><br />Memories of this TT were being helped out with engine parts by Peter Williams when the big end seized in practice and sat next to Mike Hailwood in the waiting area at the start of the race who kindly gave tips and advice.  <br /><br />Returning a year later, Peter took his own Greeves RCS Silverstone over to the Island for the 1968 TT but failed to finish when the gearbox seized on the  down to Quarter Bridge on the first lap.  <br /><br />For the 1969 TT he took a new Greeves RES Silverstone over and after a trouble free run in the 250cc race finished 25th and last out of 102 starters.<br /><br />The 1970 TT was Peters best, again entered in the Lightweight race on the well sorted Greeves, he was the only British bike to finish and received a Bronze Replica at an average speed was just under 80 mph.  Kel Carruthers won the race at a speed of 96.13 mph on the works Yamaha.  Peters time could have been better but he was slowed right down being first to arrive at the tragic crash of Herrero at the 13th milestone losing momentum and time. Obvious highlight of this year was winning and collecting the Bronze Replica.<br /><br />Remember that riders in the Lightweight 250cc class in the TT had to do 6 laps up to and including the 1970 event.<br /><br />Returning back to the TT in 1971 entering the Lightweight 250 class with his Greeves he finished 35th and was the only British bike in the results.<br /><br /><br /><br />Peter PlattAugust 2006<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e92643e68f6af5a04c655fdf815ed203.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/caaad69a6dd58543728ba78060b78e93.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/daa87c7df02995b624590ba33c453a6f.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

Taking a coveted double in the latter year.Riding Italian machines throughout, his first victory came on a 125cc Mondial in the Golden Jubilee Ultra Lightweight Race of 1957.Changing to MV Agusta machines in 1958 the fiery Italian took the chequered flag in that years Lightweight TT.Twelve months later, Provini scored a unique double in the 125cc and 250cc classes  the last time the 10.79-mile course was used.  Nineteen-Sixty saw Tarquinio move to Morini, another Italian concern - chiefly because Count Agusta had withdrawn the smaller MVs from competition  bringing the single cylinder machine home in third place.His last rides at the TT were in 1965 on the four-cylinder Benelli machines, gaining a fine fourth place in the Lightweight 250 TT of that year.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b25b63d12411d63150d22c62ff8dda5d.jpg,,,,,,4,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5

On his very first attempt, he won the 1961 Junior Race on a Norton. A third place on a Gilera in the 1963 Senior and a second place on an AJS in the 1964 Junior was his best results in those years and it wasnt until he joined Yamaha in 1965 that he got back to his winning ways. Two Lightweight and three 125cc race wins put him back on the top step of the podium. Read stopped competing in the TT in 1973, but decided to make a comeback in 1977 and won the TT Formula 1 and Senior Races.

He previously raced in the Manx Grand Prix between 1978 and 1980 where his best place was runner-up in the 1980 Senior.His first TT netted him a retirement in the Junior 250 and a 19th place in the Senior along with his first Bronze Replica. Gaining his first Silver Replica in 1982 for fourth place in the 250 race, the Ulsterman collected a further Bronze for ninth in the Senior.1983 was a year to be forgotten  three starts resulted in three D.N.F.s. The following year was not quite as bad with two finishes out of four races - third in the 250 and fourth in the Senior. 1985 once again proved to be a disappointing year  with three retirements and a 21st in the Senior.Fortunes were to change twelve months later, as the Banbridge man took his first victory in the Formula Two race. He held the lead from start to finish with a new race record of 109.72 mph and a new lap record at 11.75 mph. His joy was short lived however, for a spill at Ballaugh Bridge during the Junior Race put him out for some weeks.Brians luck deserted him once more in 1987  two races and two retirements although it was back with him again in 1988 as he completed all four races he entered: Production D  3rd; F1- 10th; Junior 250  2nd and Senior 18th. The TT beckoned again in 1989, but it was a disastrous event.A new decade brought Brian his second win, this time in the Supersport 600 and he took fifth place in the SS400. 1991 was yet again a no result year for the Dromore rider with three starts and three retirements.However, Speedie Reidie as he had become known made up for the disappointment of the previous year, by achieving a double victory in 1992. Firstly winning the Supersport 400 race, then the Junior 250  both on Loctite Yamaha machines. He luck deserted him though in the F1 and SS600 TTs.The 1993 TT saw Brian again on the top step of the podium with a win in the Junior 250cc. He was 4th in the SS400 class and in the Senior, once again riding his 250 he came home 21st, the second 250 to finish. Brian rode well in 1994 on Winston McAdoos Yamaha taking second place in the Junior. Sadly his career was brought to a premature end when he was involved in a serious accident at the Temple 100, suffering a badly broken leg and arm, his worst ever crash, which ultimately forced him to retire from the sport.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/11397892742d1b570eec7c44ea4775a2.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/80f671db540cab5a7b0f264d2d137dcb.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/a4306ae2cd12d5c0802608484fdc06d7.jpg,,,,5,3,2,3,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,24

Theyre usually about 2.5 miles long with about 13 turns. This one isnt half the work, but you need a lot more concentration.<br /><br />"" Youve got to respect the course. Youve got to take your time  you cant just go slamming into corners. We were told to treat it like a Sunday drive, and thats what weve been doing. We didnt intend to push ourselves beyond what we could do. We told the friends who customised the outfit to make it look good because that was the only way we were going to get noticed!<br /><br />""We never expected to get among the winners, or even in the first 20, but even coming here we achieved more than most Americans even hope to do. But we feel we went quite well considering. We were surprised at our times, which have been around the 31-minute mark.<br /><br />""When you come here youve just got to forget everything youve done and behave as if its your first track. I dont think its a dangerous course  I think its the attitude of the rider that makes its dangerous. Its only when people try to do more than theyre capable of. You have to be careful to use your head. <br /><br />""There are lots of little turns and blind spots. Back home, four times around and you know the course. But not here.<br /><br />""Once you get into the Mountains everything looks the same  all the turns look alike and you can lose yourself very easily. Theres a lot to learn. Theres one section up there, for instance, where there are three or four left hand turns that arent marked  theyre not really turns  and I kept missing them.<br /><br />""The course as a whole is very well marked, but the signs are further from the corners than you expect  lots of people obviously go an awful lot faster  so I tended to set up for the corner too early. But its better than being too late!""<br /><br />Alma found the course bumpy in spots  and hard on her leathers. After the fourth practice lap she was well on the way through the third patch on her bottom!<br /><br />As this was their first visit, the Rocheleaus decided to stick to one bike, a stock-engined BSA triple. ""Its reliable and thats what you need,"" said Alma.<br /><br />But the trip has fulfilled a great ambition  for the couple. ""In the States this is the ultimate. So few Americans get to come here,"" said Alma.<br /><br />She has been racing for four years, and into the sport through a bet. She was watching a race one-day and told her husband that if he got a chair she would passenger for him.<br /><br />Two weeks later he arrived  complete with outfit. ""I just couldnt let our friends, who bet that I wouldnt dare get in it, win, so I rode it  and that was it. I loved it.""<br /><br />And in the four years theyve been a team Alma  and Joe have picked up a lot of awards. In their first year she was voted passenger of the year [an award that means she has improved most]; last year they came second in their club [the Canadian Sidecar Association] championship; this year they won the clubs Sportsmanship Trophy  and theyve won the award for the best American team for the past four years.<br /><br />Joe enjoys sidecar racing so much now that after ten years solo riding he has at last sold his solo machine.<br /><br />""He wasnt enjoying it any more because he was so worried he might get injured and not be able to ride the chair.""<br /><br />After their first TT Joe and Alma are determined to come back. ""We love the Island and the atmosphere  its really fantastic. Its going to take a few years before we afford to come back again to race  but well be back next year just to watch,"" said Alma.<br /><br />Motor Cycle 22nd June 1974<br /><br /><br /><br />Sidecar Racers Association Championship: 1973  2nd; 1974  2nd; 1975  1st; 1976  1st.<br /><br />Information provided by Joe &amp; Alma Rocheleau.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b5e6b5618a2a671b1e2d7271e5bfdd76.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/24673519caa219a21e6208719228cabe.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/fdd4f7ae0b014be1ea5516b184b86d9e.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Despite this setback he started racing in 1960 at a British Motor Cycle Racing Club Meeting at Silverstone. His first race was in the production class on a 204cc Ducati and he won the 250cc class, and it was again on a Ducati that he achieved his major success in the TT making him the first rider to win a TT race on a DUCATI.  <br /><br />His racing was entirely self-financed which meant a lot of sacrifices had to be made.He always preferred to race in the lightweight classes enjoying the challenge of coaxing the last possible scrap of speed and power out of a small bike.  Like many of the riders of his time, his finances were unequal to the challenge of keeping up with the latest imports from Germany, Italy and Spain. So in order to compete in 1963 he ended up choosing the production class as the most competitive for the money.<br /><br />He competed at most of the major circuits and in late 64 bought the Ducati Mach 1, which he used to win the Production TT in 1969.  He achieved numerous successes on this machine at club and national level finally going international at Brands Hatch by competing in the long distance 500-mile race.  He competed as a privateer in three 500-mile races even getting together a team of two bikes and four riders including himself. Although success came close, tantalisingly it was never to be. On the last occasion in 1968, partnered by his friend and future 500-Production T.T. winner Graham Penny, he was knocked off his machine while leading his class. <br /><br />1967, the TTs Diamond Jubilee, was his first race in the Isle of Man Production TT After a race long dice with Eddy Crooks on a Suzuki, a mistake on the last lap cost him a bent exhaust valve and failure to finish.  The following year was a very contentious and controversial race in which the winner and second man were excluded from the results by the A.C.U.  Mike should have been credited with a 6th place but R.A.C overrode the A.C.U. decision and reinstated the winners so he was finally placed 8th. 1969, the year of his win, was probably the fairest race for years.  The rules defining what a production bike was and what modifications could or could not be made to the machines were very strictly enforced.  The result was a very close race in which reliability played a decisive role allowing Mike to grab the win he so richly deserved. <br /><br />He retired from racing at the end of that year and is now living in Teddington.   <br /><br /><br /><br />March 2007<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e7fc0576c7ef8c3038ebc9b20baec5e5.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/12d0192e01ae23b8bf717b0cd7e7c199.jpg,,,,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Later in the week he finished 26th in the Classic TT after a long stop to wire up and secure the exhaust system which had broken. <br /><br />In 1980 he rode a new TZ500 Yamaha entered by Hailwood &amp; Gould in the Senior TT, finishing 24th and retiring in the Classic TT with gearbox trouble. <br /><br />In the one-off Historic TT in 1984 he rode a 7R AJS belonging to John Holder.

However, he appealed to the FIM twice and was eventually declared the winner.Fritz and John won the Sidecar World Championship back to back in 1965 and 1966.Sadly Fritz was killed at a meeting at Mallory Park in March 1967, passenger John suffered only a broken leg, but it was enough for him to retire from the sport.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/bd48698a8b9d54ad8e9cc796a939911e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/4395095c7b613e79ff7a7f50fd3910a0.jpg,,,,,1,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

His spectacular crash at Daytona in 1975 inflicted enough injuries to fill several pages in a medical dictionary. The scars and metalwork left on and in his body were horrific and everyone knew about them because the crash was seen on television and replayed time and again.  Suddenly, watching his body seemingly being battered to destruction morbidly fascinated an audience that had never taken much interest in bike racing.  <br /><br />The interest was heightened when, after he had recovered, his next appearances on television were the inevitable interviews and chat shows in which with extraordinary coherence he recalled the incident.  Here was a biker who did not fit the perceived mould of scruffy character in dreary black leathers.  Sheene wore white and was seen to be immensely likeable, witty, fashionable and certainly fun-loving.  But his determination to be paid what he thought he was worth put the Isle of Man out of bounds. He raced there once, in 1971, and that was enough to convince him that the risks were not worth the potential rewards.<br /><br />Born in London in 1950, he inherited his interest in motorcycling from his father, Frank, who had himself raced.  With parental encouragement, he had his first race on his fathers Bultaco when he was seventeen and at twenty became the British 125cc champion.  His career moved forward as rapidly as he raced.  Riding an ex-works Suzuki, he finished second in the world championship 125cc class in 1971, the year that saw him win his first grand prix, the Belgian, followed by two more. That was also the year in which he made his only appearance on the Isle of Man. Riding in the Lightweight race on the Suzuki he fell off at Quarter Bridge and retired in the 250cc Production race.<br /><br />The 1972 season brought so many indifferent results that he almost despaired of improving his career but Yamaha had been watching and knew his potential.  They offered him their latest water-cooled 250 twin which he rode in South Africa.  Back in Europe he soon found that the machine was not competitive.  Not only that he crashed at Imola and spent time in hospital.  By the time he was fit again he had decided to abandon Yamaha. The following year he was signed up by Suzuki GB.  This time everything gelled.  He rode impressively in the 1974 British Superbike championship as well as in the FIM Formula 750cc races and won the first British Grand Prix at Silverstone at a record 107.74mph.  <br /><br />It was on the Suzuki that the following year he crashed in practice at Daytona at some 175mph and after sliding for several hundred yards lay still on the grass.  Astonishingly, he was still alive but had a broken left thigh, right arm, two ribs and right collarbone.  He had twisted his back and had burns.<br /><br />Typical of the mans courage and determination, he was racing again after a month but with an eighteen inch pin holding a leg together. Later in the season he came off again, resulting in another leg fracture.  Yet his indomitable spirit was still intact.  His ambition was to restore Britains prestige in the 500ccworld championship (only Phil Read in 1973 and 1974 had won the title over a ten year period).<br /><br />So in 1976 he won five grands prix, not only bringing him the title but sweeping all opposition aside. His bluntness in negotiations for what he considered a fair days pay for a tough and dangerous days work was never far away.  In that world title winning season he refused to ride in the last three rounds.<br /><br />His retained his world title in 1977 by a huge margin.  The Suzuki was clearly superior to all the other machines and Sheenes image had given motorcycling a huge boost.  The predictions were that he would continue to win world championships at will.  Kenny Roberts, the American champion, had other ideas.  The experts reckoned he would find the European circuits a lot different to those in the States and probably soon be on his way home.<br /><br />Roberts made no initial impression on the grand prix circuit but then he won the 1978 Spanish Grand Prix and consistently beat Sheene who was not fully fit because of a severe virus infection but reluctantly conceded that the American on his enormously quick Yamaha, was a worthy champion.  Sheene never tired of making quips about Roberts ability, or as he saw it, his lack of it, but the pair linked to fight for better financial rewards for all riders.  <br /><br />By 1979 Roberts was the king of a changed sport: one that had become brighter, vastly more popular and media-friendly than it had ever been. Sheene was unhappy with the machine Suzuki had developed and he was right.  Roberts kept his title. In 1980 Sheene formed his own team with Yamaha machinery. He struggled against the works bikes but determinedly continued racing and in 1981 was offered a works ride by Yamaha and came fifth in the world championship while winning several domestic events.<br /><br />With his confidence returned, he got on the podium five times in the early part of the 1982 season but without a win.  He was determined to change that at the British GP at Silverstone but it was there that he suffered a crash even more damaging than that at Daytona. Falling from an enormously quick Yamaha V-4 that Roberts had been using earlier in the season, his life came perilously close to ending.  <br /><br />In free practice he was lapping near the record.  At almost 160mph he hit a machine of a fallen rider.  His bike burst into flames.  He slid for 150 yards. Few people there thought he had survived.  His girl-friend Stephanie Maclean, who had been portrayed as a steadying influence on Sheene but knew that he was obsessed with racing, was quickly on the scene, as was Sheenes father.  His son was again a crumpled mess with two broken legs and a badly broken left arm.<br /><br />Amazingly Sheene decided that he was not finished with racing.  He took up an offer from Heron Suzuki GB and rode surprisingly well on the 1983 GP circuits and finished eighth at Silverstone, one year after his terrible crash.  The following season he continued to race competitively on the semi-works machinery but in 1985 he decided to move into car racing, competing in the British saloon car series.  He went on to enjoy racing trucks, riding in classic bike events (with almost inevitable success) and moved to Australia where he become a hugely popular commentator on motor sport. <br /><br />His lively personality seemed indestructible, which made it all the more astounding that in 2002 he announced that he had cancer, to which he finally succumbed on Sunday 9th March 2003.<br /><br /><br /><br />Copyright Norman Fox    <br /><br /><br /><br />    Link: <a href=""http://www.dukevideo.com"" target=""new"">Champion Barry SheeneVideo</a>.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/577df694ea93f39da2ec44fcd0b1e18c.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/62139ad4232b79c1a96e18f7d0816798.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/05f3caf4459b7a9cd4494d3a078c09d8.jpg,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

Dickie was granted a factory backed Norton and privateer Triumph rides but was dogged with tyre problems and in 1948 he was the victim of someone elses accident at Union Mills from which he lost the use of his left hand. <br /><br />Always a keen fan we visited the TT several times in the 80s and he seemed so at home there. He kept various diaries, which showed his meticulous preparation, as he watched the more experienced riders at numerous points on the circuit, noting lines and times. <br /><br />His early retirement from the sport was at a time when he was just about to move into the limelight as this press cutting tells:- <br /><br /><i>R. P. Dickie Siffleet, a flight engineer with BOAC at Hurn, rode in the Senior Clubmans TT on a Triumph Tiger 100and did well in practice.He was tipped as a likely winner before the race, but five miles along the 150 mile course, Dickie had a flat tyre  and that was that....</i><br /><br />My father never trusted Dunlops again...!<br /><br />He loved his bikes, especially British, and when I started Drag Racing a blown Triumph in the early 80''s he was my staunch supporter and got as much pleasure in watching and ''spannering'' for me as he did riding himself. By this time, his left arm had had to be completely removed but this left him no less a mechanic and engineer. He joined the final tour <i>d''honneur</i> in 1992.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Richard G.

He also finished second in the Junior and Senior that year on Nortons. This was scant reward for a brilliant career on the Isle of Man. He set numerous record and fastest laps before retiring from races and was the first man to set  60mph, 70mph and 80mph laps of the course. These feats were acknowledged by naming a trophy after him. The Jimmy Simpson Trophy is annually awarded to the TT rider who sets the fastest lap of the week.

He passed away at the Vinohrady Hospital in Prague, after a long illness.<br /><br />Stastny was a phenomenal motorcycle racer, and successful representative of Czechoslovakia and the Jawa factory. He participated in the road racing world championships in the 1950's, 1960's &amp; 1970's, as well as the Isle of Man Tourist Trophy. Stastny dominated road racing in Czechoslovakia during his career, gaining 60 victories on his home soil. But many times he experienced the crash as well, resulting in many injuries, including the loss of a kidney, and 27 broken bones. Franta was faithful to Jawa during his entire racing career, even though he received many lucrative offers from other motorcycle factories, including MV Agusta.<br /><br />When he retired, Stastny worked as a TV commentator on sport programs, and a few times participated in car races, including Fiesta Cup. <br /><br />Franta Stastny was a phenomenal friend, restless joker, and great storyteller. He was more than popular in the world of motorcycle road racing, and it was the greatest honour for stars like Agostini or Hailwood to become close friends to him.<br /><br /><br /><br />The above information was kindly supplied by Martin Ostry.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/a5c59bdac4dbd07643ba1afaeb9c871f.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d2b5e6c7c5e28d87af1e138327447864.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c1a57c1ded5248176c5f830d5c34f012.jpg,,,,0,0,2,1,2,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4

Altogether Surtees competed in 15 TT races and finished in all except the 1956 Junior.  He rode Nortons first in 1954 finishing 11th in the Junior and 15th in the Senior. He turned to MV Agusta in 1956 and his record reads - 1956 Senior 1st, 1957 Junior 4th, Senior 2nd, 1958 Junior and Senior 1st, a feat he repeated in 1959, and 1960 Senior 1st and Junior 2nd. An enviable record! At the end of the 1960 season, Surtees decided to finish his motorcycling career and turned to four wheels, going on to win the F1 World Drivers Championship. His immaculate style and preparation of his racing machines was a winning combination; his speed on track and sportsmanship off it made him a well-loved and popular figure.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b79dc8b98dfe09217b55a040e721bc75.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/a9bedd0c0198b4d62b561ca25abde1ef.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b1125c763fc5eda5760cb36b0ef1af33.jpg,,,,6,2,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It was to be one of mixed fortunes, retiring in the Lightweight 250cc race, then taking second place in the Lightweight 125cc TT.He subsequently became a works rider for Ducati, MZ and Kreidler before joining the Honda factory in 1961.On the little 125-twin he came home second to Mike Hailwood in the three-lap race.Nineteen Sixty-two saw him score the first of a total of three victories on the Mountain Course in the Lightweight 125 TT, setting a race record of 89.88 mph in the process as he headed off team mates Tommy Robb and Tom Phillis.His second win came two years later, again in the 125 category, yet again increasing the race record to 02.14 mph and setting a new lap record at 95.53mph on the 4-cylinder 125 Honda.The ever-popular Taveri gained his third and final TT victory twelve months later in the 50cc TT, ahead of the Suzuki opposition of Hugh Anderson and Ernst Degner.Luigi gained eight Silver and one Bronze Replica during his TT career, whilst achieving the distinction of World Champion in the 125cc class three times in 1962, 1964 and 1964.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/d219b5a8a8a8fae1cc75a8726fbcdae5.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/cd3e25fdbb09605b62bc656bf5cdf2b7.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/5beb617d60ff6419459ab45cf9ecf52c.jpg,,,,3,7,2,1,0,0,1,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6

With passenger Kenny Arthur on their Yamaha outfit they finished second in the debut race, backing that up with a third in the second race.Jocks luck was not to be repeated in 1979, collecting his only D.N.F of his TT career in the first of the two sidecar races and coming home 16th in the second.New passenger, Benga Johansson assisted in the team achieving second place to Trevor Ireson in the first of the races in 1980. Going one better in the second to take their first victory. In both races they set the fastest lap!The end of the season saw them Sidecar World Champions.1981 saw race and lap records broken as the Scots/Swedish pairing sped to what was to be the first part of a double win. The following year was to be one of mixed fortunes, starting as favourites, they hit major problems on the opening lap, eventually finishing 18th.Jock and Benga made up for their disappointment in the second race by taking the chequered flag ahead of husband and wife team of Dennis and Julia Bingham. Setting a new lap record at 108.29 mph in the process.As it turned out it was to be their last TT, as Jock was killed at the Finnish Grand Prix at Imatra later on in the year.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b028a0638f5e584a0e2c635106c77c7c.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/190699d352d6587e7a31cf9d988519a0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/8f05e6d1f3ad6700fe00431213161198.jpg,,,,4,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He was educated at the local Twyn, Secondary Modern School.  <br /><br />He served an apprenticeship at the Caerphilly Loco Sheds (BritishRail) as a Fitter, Turner and Erector. Due to his hearing problems, hefailed his medical for National Service in 1956 and decided to stay on as aFitter with the company for many years after. <br /><br />His main interest at this time, was swimming, model Aircraftdesign and manufacture and most of all, motorcycling. His first Motorcyclewas a Hand Change Arial (Which he attempted to Break the Sound Barrier on).He entered the Taff Swim each year at Roath Park Lake and never failed tofinish. <br /><br />When he commenced his Motor racing career, he financed andprepared his own Norton Motorcycle in the little shed at the rear of hishome. Right from the start, it was obvious that he was someone special andhad the potential to go right to the top of the sport. All he needed wassupport.    <br /><br />His second love was flying his Glider, a number of times he wasforced to land near Motorways, he never knew when to come down. <br /><br />Unfortunately, Malcolm died in 1999 due to Asbestosis, I believeit was a legacy from his days as a Fitter working on the Boiler Mountinggang at Caerphilly Sheds. <br /><br />We served our apprenticeships together and were Pals for most of his life. <br /><br />David Davies.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/abdab916ab2b667cdce7b86c1f9337a0.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/de3bc8a8e1399ef68c876d9416df465e.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/917fc62c5a8b59f06d625cda2ea0d7c8.jpg,,,,2,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9

WAGAR    (1930-2004)   <br /><br />Ivan Wagar was born in Napanee, a small Canadian town in south-eastern Ontario some 50 miles from the confluence of the mighty St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario...As a local boy he battled his way to the top hurdling many obstacles to become highly ranked in North American motorcycle circles... <br /><br />  Ivans first bike was a 1948 Triumph Tiger 100 bought in the following year...On this he indulged a strong fancy for fast touring until the activities of two club colleagues gave rise to his urge to race...<br /><br />    So, in 1950, the T100 was replaced by a Thunderbird on which he finished fourth in his first airfield race behind three Vincent twins.... Thus encouraged, he bought an even more potent Triumph, - a Grand Prix model and collected three first place finishes at the Ontario championship meeting in August 1950... This highly satisfying achievement he was to repeat again in 1951. <br /><br />Ivan by this time was smitten with the racing bug so he boarded ship and sailed away to test his skills at a race like no other.<br /><br />     Every June, The Isle Of Man shuts down its public roads so that madmen- and a madwoman or two- can hurtle through city streets, never far from danger or thousands of adoring fans.<br /><br /> And its not just the meek and timid that the TT intimidates...Local legend has it that GP star Barry Sheene pulled out at Quarter Bridge, barely two miles from the start, never to set wheel on the Isle of Man again...<br /><br /> It is unbelievable how fast everyone was going over roads that normally serve as the islands main thoroughfare, over mountains, past farms and, most incredibly, through its villages. Todays speeds can reach over 175 mph.Ivan twice raced at the Isle of Man.Representing Canada in 1952 aboard a Triumph he placed 39th in the Senior TT, and in 1954 as a privateer in the Junior TT mounted on a Norton he placed 53 rd. He also entered the Senior race on a Norton but because of spark plug leads problems he had a DNF in this race.<br /><br /> In 1953 Ivan seriously contemplated retiring from racing and settling down to a more orthodox life...But by midyear his resultant restlessness was too much to bear, and he rode in the Ontario championships to win the 500 cc race.The same mental vacillation plagued him again in 1954, however with his boat sailing only three days off he decided in favour of a continuance of racing at the TT, duly embarking at Liverpool on Apr 5th.<br /><br /> It would be difficult to imagine a more cheerful and friendly soul than Ivan Wagar, possessed of an almost boyish countenance and an infectious grin, he is always completely at ease.<br /><br />     Ivan was introduced to the motorcycle in his early teens...Bitten by the racing bug he became the Canadian Road Racing Champion after two fast years of campaigning.<br /><br /> Among his European trophies are two of the most coveted, the Isle of Man TT replicas.<br /><br />     In 1955 after emigrating from Canada to Southern California, Ivan set lap records at Willow Springs and Riverside race courses in the 350 class, also set a land speed record that stood for many years on the famous Bonneville salt flats of Utah on a 350 Honda and won the AFM 350 championship in 1964 before joining Cycle World as Assistant Editor in 1965...Ivan was soon to become Editor and Associate Publisher, and he explained that Cycle World was the first magazine in the United States to start conducting honest road tests for motorcycles...This system still works well today...This system referred to by Ivan is one which staff members ride machines and pool their opinions on performance. We generally agree on the overall opinion!(Ive had three broken collar bones, a broken collar bone and a hip in traction at the same time, which was particularly painful, and three broken ribs after various accidents)  reflected Ivan as he spoke of his deep involvement in motorcycle safety...This concern for safety led to his appointment to the National Motor Vehicle Safety Advisory Council in June 1970 when he became the first motorcyclist among the 21-member Council.<br /><br />     With motorcycle sales booming Ivan was instrumental in planning new rider-training programs...The Big Six motorcycle manufacturers contributed over $5,000,000. towards implementing them, Ivan explains.<br /><br />    Another Canadian who raced on the Island was Ted Havens...After the IOM races Ted and Ivan entered the Ulster Grand Prix races on the Emerald Isle....This resulted in a lifelong friendship over the years.<br /><br />     Ivan was an advisor on motorcycle safety to JAMA  ( Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association),member of the committee on helmets of the American National Standards Institute, member of the executive committee of the American Motorcycle Association, as well as such AMA committees as professional racing and member  Insurance advisory committee...He did motor racing broadcasts for network radio and was founding President and chairman of the rider licensing committee of the Motorcycle Industry Council.<br /><br /> He also was in Madrid, Spain as a delegate from the USA. to the world governing body of motorcycle racings annual congress.<br /><br /><u>Post Script:</u><br /><br />Representing Canada at the time of the 1952 TT Ivan made the acquaintance of Barbara ( who was to become his future wife).  They dated a few times, then Ivan along with Ted Havens raced at the Ulster GP in Ireland, after which he was employed by BSA for a stretch, then returned home to Canada...Again in 1954 Ivan raced at the IOM TT and at this time Barbara and Ivan rekindled their friendship... Their decision was to be married in Canada at a later date.. Ivan returned home to await the arrival of Barbara who set sail in 1955...Their marriage took place in Napanee where they resided for four years...In 1959 they, along with Ivans parents, emigrated to the USA where Ivan decided to race stateside...Ivan and Barbara spent many happy years together and when Ivan retired they settled in Olympia Washington.<br /><br /> Always remembered -by wife and best friend Barbara - and friend Allan Sinclair.<br /><br /><br /><br /> June 2005 <br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/b8bf44030f309fdf45bcac99c537df34.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

An entry the following year proved no better when the 250cc Greeves broke down on the Mountain Mile during the opening lap. 1966 proved to be more successful when, on the first Suzuki ever to take part in the Manx, Frank came home in 11th place collecting his first Replica. In 1967, on the new Suzuki TR250 racer, Frank started the race as favourite after setting the first Lightweight lap at over 90mph in practice on this very quick two-stroke twin. Unfortunately the race was run in atrocious weather causing the organisers to reduce the race distance from 4 to 3 laps and this meant that the winner, Brian Ball, was able to complete the race non-stop putting Frank in a disappointing second place. However, in 1968 fortune smiled when he managed to secure the long awaited win on his 250cc Crooks Suzuki.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/564d51ff667c0eb34388175e2dae9449.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/c81d5ee3699a5e80f9464d27c0d39a7f.jpg,,,,,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

In that time he won a total of four races, the first in 1971 and the last in 1976. His debut ride in the Senior of 1968 on a Matchless Metisse provided him with his first silver replica for 11th position. From then on his TT career progressed with the usual ups and downs that become part of a road racers lifestyle. 1971 was to see Johns initial victory, riding a 500 Honda in the Production Race, which he led from start to finish. (It was to be a Williams benefit - namesake Peter broke the lap record in the 750 class and Charlie set the fastest lap in the 250 as John also broke the lap record in the 500!) John was to repeat his Production win in 1972, this time in the 250cc class still Honda mounted. The remainder of that year saw him retire in the Junior, come hone 7th in the F.750 and the 250 Lightweight saw him in 3rd place. However, the Senior was to prove the metal of the man, riding a G50 Matchless he was up against the might of the MV Team of Agostini and Pagani, managing to split the pair for most of the race, only to be reported as touring at the Bungalow on his final circuit. Many a rider would have stopped, but not John, he rode down the Mountain and pushed in from Governors to take 28th place out of 36 finishers. 1973 recorded a brace of retirements, a third and two runner positions, whilst his 1974 effort saw his consistently on the leaderboard during practice, only to crash during the last session on the Friday evening, sidelining for race week. Fully fit for the 1975 TT he was third in the 250; second in the Senior and took his first big TT win taking the flag in the Classic 1000cc Race. With full factory backing from Suzuki in 1976, his confidence was high with a 500 for the Senior and a 750 for the Classic. From a standing start in the Senior he broke the lap record and upped it on his second circuit and continued to lead for the remaining four laps. However, just as he was in sight of the chequered flag the 500 Suzuki went dead  out of petrol. Determined to finish he pushed the big machine over the line for 7th place, collapsing with exhaustion. Making up for his disappointment he won the Classic TT with the added satisfaction of setting new class and lap record of 108.18 mph and 110.21 mph. Although back as a privateer in 1977 his TT expectations were high, but it was not to be  in both races, the Classic and the Senior he retired with engine problems. 1978 was to be Johns final TT  though no one knew that at the time  In the Formula One Race he was aboard a works Honda which he brought home into 2nd place behind the legendary Mike Hailwood. In the Senior, this time on a Suzuki, he was holding second place for 4 of the 6 laps behind Tom Herron, when he was forced to retire on the 5th lap with a split water hose whilst going down the Cronk-y-voddy straight. For the Classic 1000cc race John chose the smaller 500cc Suzuki. Mick Grant won on his 750 Kawasaki with John having to settle for 2nd in front of the other 750s.",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/e8fc67b6ef5ef831b785803a89cff3aa.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/669593fdb73035b012ec17882c58d371.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/acaeadf096418642106d0b706afb7fec.jpg,,,,4,6,3,1,1,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9

The family moved to Surrey, first to Coldharbour and then to Abinger Common in 1953, where he attended Abinger and Beare Green Schools.<br /><br />After leaving school, he became an apprentice plumber with a well-known Dorking central heating company, K Frogley Ltd.  He studied at Guildford Technical College and became a qualified plumber.<br /><br />Rob started riding motorcycles in 1960 with various two-stroke trials bikes.  He also had an AMC outfit, well, a float for carrying the trials bikes.  He gained notoriety for miles around, at the way he fearlessly drove the outfit, in fact it is still a legend today.  With the two strokes came a rigid trials iron.  People still remember the day at a Dorking closed to club trial in the Chalk pits, how he tackled a section with large boulders up an incredibly steep hill, which had stopped many a rider.  Rob stood on the pegs, nailed it, and in a superb ride, cleaned it.<br /><br />After a fairly successful trials career, the highlights, of which were the quick events, he turned to Scrambles, eventually riding a Greeves challenger, where a fearless streak really started to emerge.<br /><br />Rob thrived on being on the ragged edge.  At a Half Crown Trial at Liphook, he borrowed brother Johns 500T Norton which ended up with the rear wheel like a three penny piece.   At a Tinsley Green Scramble, with a large artificial jump, he fell off nearly every lap it was more important to get a good jump than to do well in the race.<br /><br />Rob could cause mayhem. The rear garden of his parents house was often covered with large quantities of parts from various motorcycles, a lot of them from AMC, with Rob sat in the middle, covered up to elbows in black grease.<br /><br />Then the inevitable happened, Rob meet Sam and they married in 1968.  They emigrated to Australia the following year, leaving his fathers garden with large chunks of aluminium casings corroding away below the top surface.  Daughter Kate was born in 1971, but by 1972 the homeland and Surrey called, so they decided to return and take in a few sights and hardships along the way.  They purchased an old VW camper and drove it home, through India, Parkistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece and then the whole of Europe.  He eventually settled in Farnham with his family, now including Becca and Oliver.<br /><br />Rob was a good engineer he knew the plumbing, heating and air conditioning business well.  Eventually, he became a partner in Argent Engineering, a mechanical and electrical services company, who are well know in the refurb and refit business, particularly in London.<br /><br />But the passion still haunted him.  In 1980, a 1949 AJS 7R found its way into his shed but was found to be rather slow and uncompetitive amongst the quicker and more modern classic machinery.  A 350cc Manx Norton was purchased and he started racing in earnest, with many notable rides on the mainland, particularly in the wet.  In fact, at one rather wet Brands meeting, he became know as Fearless Rob with head down and on the stop, using the grass if necessary.  The Manx Grand Prix called and Rob with Allen Davey as mechanic made the trip to the Island and had a wonderful time.  A 500cc Norton was acquired and a return to the MGP, which was to become his favourite event, gaining finishers awards every year in the Senior and Junior Classic Races.  <br /><br />Rob loved the Manx GP and he loved the Isle of Man.  Standing on the dock waiting to go home he would say Only 50 weeks and 2 days and I will be back and he was, with his two unfaired Manxs known as Robs Old Nails.<br /><br />Thursday 27 August 1998 was dry with some sun.   He put in a cracking practice lap on the 350cc bike, came into the pit absolutely chuffed with life, got onto the 500cc bike and went off towards Bray Hill in high spirits, doing what he loved most, riding his bike on the Island.  Rob got as far as Union Mills.<br /><br />Rob was a great sportsman. He loved the Island, the race and the pace.  He knew the risks.  He knew the ultimate price, which he paid. <br /><br /><br /><br />Cynthia Wingrave2005<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/562f0f45244e7e644c40114721db6788.jpg,,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I also raced a 3 1/2 (350cc vee twin) Moto Morini in the F3 event.  The bike is actually my wifes, which she loaned out following a road crash, and was race prepared by North Leicester Motors.  Following the TT I restored the Morini and Christine having owned it from new in 1978 still runs it!  Does this qualify me to ride it in the parade lap??<br /><br />I returned in 1981 sponsored by Elby Moto to ride a Moto Morini (no. 89) in the F3 and a 900cc Benelli six (no 66) in the F1.  The Morini was tuned and fitted with 400cc barrels and air suspension.  Practice was fraught with problems and the Morini was never able to run at full power until race day.  The result was a fast bike that matched the Yamahas but which shattered the rear piston on the Cronk ny Voddy on lap 1.  <br /><br />The Benelli similarly had problems and it was only possible to do one lap in practice.  It ran well and sounded even better in the race but two slow pit stops caused a poor result being classified as 34th out of 35 finishers.   <br /><br />As far as I know I am the last person to race a Moto Morini or a Benelli 900 six in the Island.<br /><br /><br /><br />Trevor Wise<br /><br /><br /><br />",http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/59ed9fc49d1b3df52b11753ae51fdb9c.jpg,http://www.iomtt.com/images/cache/cc82f2ffab3d6e2184aefcfa698e3151.jpg,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2

403,Stanley Woods,http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/competitors.aspx?ride_id=403&filter=W,N,"<img class=""floatleft"" src="""" alt=""Photograph"" />The magic of the Isle of Man has been enhanced by many of motorcycling's wizards but few riders have built its reputation more significantly than Stanley Woods.  He was once voted the greatest TT rider of all time, and not without good reason.  His bravery, especially in difficult conditions, and mastery of tactical racing brought him ten TT victories and eleven fastest laps.<br /><br />Above all he was a motorcycle enthusiast.  It hardly mattered whether it was a trials bike, scrambler, grass track machine, speedway bike or road racer, he loved them all equally and was outstandingly good on each.  The prime of his era was the early to mid-1930s.<br /><br />He was born in Dublin in 1905 and once old enough to ride road machines convinced himself that he was good enough to race.  Always a lively character, his confidence was never lacking. When he was seventeen and had experienced some racing in Ireland, he wrote to the Cotton company telling them that he was good enough to be trusted with one of their bikes to race on the island.  He made out that he had already been promised a Senior machine, which was pure blarney.  Surprisingly Mr F.W. Cotton agreed but in Woods first TT, the Junior in 1922, the engine was ailing when he finished.  In spite of that he was fifth and had managed to get round after all manner of problems including a broken exhaust pipe and a moment in his pit when fuel caught fire and briefly set him and his machine ablaze.<br /><br />In the following year he rewarded Cotton for their confidence by winning the Junior event even after crashing into a doorway in Parliament Square and spending valuable time restoring the front forks to their original shape.  From then on his career was to stretch over twenty years.  <br /><br />For the next two years he raced various machines but also spent a lot of time trials riding.  In the 1925 Junior TT he rode a Royal Enfield but the handlebars snapped.  Not daunted, he steered on with what was left of the bar but the throttle was gone and he had to adjust his speed with the air lever.  Not surprisingly, he was ordered to stop.  <br /><br />All the time he badly wanted to get factory support from Norton.  The company had been watching his progress with interest and in 1926 they offered him a works machine for the Senior race which he duly won at a record speed of 67.54mph.  At the time he combined being a professional rider with his work as a traveller for the sweet makers Mackintoshs<br /><br />The 1927 saw him improve Jimmie Simpsons Senior TT lap record to 70.99mph before being forced to abandon with mechanical trouble.  During the race he was aware that he had no idea what his lead had been over the second placed rider until he came in to take fuel. Having been told to continue with the pace he had already been setting, which was hardly necessary since he had a five-minute lead, on the fifth lap he ruined the clutch.  His frustrating experience, together with his complaints about a lack of information being provided to the riders, brought about the system of lap signalling.  <br /><br /> On the Continent he was highly impressive.  On the Norton machines he won four of the 1927 grands prix and two more in 1928 but then he went back to Ireland to join his father in a toffee making business. Not that he gave up racing.  In 1929, however, he retired from both Senior and Junior races and in 1930 the Rudge machines were far quicker than the Nortons.  Although Norton recovered in 1931 he had mechanical problems in both races<br /><br />The Nortons made few advances technically until Joe Craig arrived to guide their development. As a result in 1932 and 1933 Woods won both Junior and Senior races.  But towards the end of 1933 he fell out with Norton.  The problem was that their machines were so dominant that the factory began to decide in advance which rider should win.  The matter came to a head at the Manx Grand Prix.  He was told that it was not his turn to finish first, but since several of the other team members dropped out, he could hardly avoid winning.  The situation led to his decision to leave Norton.  Although he rode in the 1934 Senior TT for Husqvarna (recording the fastest lap), the Italian company Moto Guzzi had won his attention.<br /><br />In 1935 he gave Moto Guzzi victories in the Senior and Lightweight races, including record laps.  In the Lightweight race he rode a wide-angled twin with extraordinary skill.  However, the Senior race was much more memorable. Indeed, it was one of the classic events in the islands history.<br /><br />The Scott Jimmy Guthrie, on a Norton, had led from the start and with a lap to go had a twenty-six second lead over Woods.  Guthrie, was a master of the course, but Woods had gradually been closing in on him from the third lap when he was behind by the best part of a minute. By the fifth lap Guthrie was still racing at record speed and looked certain to win. However, Woods increased the pace and began to eat into Guthries lead.  In the end he closed the gap and won.  In order to do so he had to improve the lap record by four miles per hour and he won by four seconds.<br /><br />The 1936 season saw him appear in the Lightweight on a German DKW, which blew up when he was leading on the fifth lap, but by then he was hankering to return to British made machines.  He signed for Velocette and gave them and second place in the 1937 Senior but he was unhappy about their road holding.  Because of his influence Velocette developed the swinging arm rear suspension.  By 1938 the machines were far more competitive and he won the Junior race and was second after a tough duel with Harold Daniell in the Senior.  His speed in the Junior, 84.08mph, was a record as was the 85.30mph in the Senior.<br /><br />In the last TT before the war (1939) he again won the Junior TT and was fourth in the Senior, riding for Velocette in both races.  His career record of ten TT victories remained until the era of Mike Hailwood.  Such was his standing in the history of the TT that in 1968 a panel of experts named him the greatest of all the islands competitors.  And in 1957 he had gone back to the island to help celebrate the Golden Jubilee by riding a 350cc Moto Guzzi round the course at just over 82mph.<br /><br /><br /><br /> Norman Fox.
