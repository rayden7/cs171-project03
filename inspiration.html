        <h2>Inspiration & Motivation</h2>

        <p>Our project comes about from a fascination with the incredibly brave and talented men (and women!) racers
            that continue to show up every year at the Isle of Man TT and challenge world records, personal bests, and
            each other.  After watching several documentaries about the annual TT races (including those already
            mentioned on the <a href="index.html">main page</a>,
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698010/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">TT3D: Closer To The Edge</a> and the BBC
            ITV4 documentary
            <a href="http://www.touchline.tv/tv/motorsport/manx-grand-prix-documentary-on-itv4">Grand Prix Racer</a>)
            David was inspired to see if he could do some interesting visualizations on rider performance, learn more
            about how long it takes riders to become proficient on the <a href="maps.html">Snaefell Mountain Course</a>,
            and also create some really fun and interactive visualizations of the rich dataset that the official
            <a href="http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database.aspx">Isle of Man TT Database website</a> provides (particularly
            because the official database website is primarily a relatively flat, boring dump of "numbers in tables"
            kind of datadump, it was ripe for being the datasource for visualizing).</p><br />
        <p>In addition to the fantastic <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698010/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">TT3D: Closer
            To The Edge</a>, we were also inspired by a few recent videos of recent Isle of Man TT events, as well as the
            Irish Northwest 200 (considered a "warm-up" race for the official Isle of Man TT) here - these are best
            viewed in full-screen and with your speakers turned all the way up:
        <ul class="left-margin-bump improvements">
            <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/46856767" target="_blank">"The Greatest Show On Earth - 200 mph Street Race - Isle of Man TT"</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/55067330" target="_blank">Most Extreme Sport - Irish Road Racing - Ulster Grand Prix - Northwest 200</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/59191280" target="_blank">The Road Warriors - Irish Road Racing and Southern 100 - Isle of Man</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://vimeo.com/59816919" target="_blank">Road Warriors 2 - North West 200, Southern 100, Isle of Man TT</a></li>

        </ul>

        <p>After David and Leo teamed up to work on the project, we were both also inspired by the example provided in
            the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7RjtnDB9_4_YTF-cg8vxSoLi8oDEuE9fSNO1nMiQWo/edit">Project
            II</a> project document of "A good multi-view example" of the
            <a href="http://cscheid.net/static/mlb足hall足of足fame足voting/">MLB Hall of Fame Voting</a>, where it showed
            lines for each player and showed how many votes they received each year until they reached (or in several
            cases, did not reach) enough votes to gain entry into the MLB Hall of Fame.  We felt that a graph like this
            for our Isle of Man TT rider and race data would be a neat way to visualize how a rider has performed in
            the TT races over the years, and give us insight into our primary research question, which is <b><i>"How
            long does it take most riders to become proficient at the Isle of Man TT?"</i></b></p><br />
        <p>We felt that we should focus our analysis of the rich 100+ year history of the Isle of Man TT by focusing in
            on the <a href="http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database/Events.aspx?era=5">modern era</a> of the
            TT because the motorcycles used today are so vastly superior to those of earlier eras that the comparison
            of older data to present-day data would not be fair (it is common for the best riders of today to reach
            speeds in excess of 200 MPH on some of the straights at the <a href="maps.html">Snaefell Mountain
            Course</a>.</p><br />

        <h2>The Isle of Man TT</h2>

        <p>The Isle of Man TT is the world's most famous, prestigious, and infamous motorcycle road race (for more
            details about what the TT is, please see the <a href="about.html">About</a> page).  Our
            visualization is focused on visualizing rider race performance across all of the variety of race
            classes (there are several).</p>
        <p>The TT race is run on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snaefell_mountain_course">Snaefell
            Mountain Course</a> is a notoriously difficult and challenging course, and conventional wisdom is that
            it takes anywhere from 3 - 10 years of racing on the course to become proficient (this range was taken
            as a direct quote from both the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1698010/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">TT3D:
                Closer To The Edge</a> documentary, as well as a BBC ITV4 documentary
            <a href="http://www.touchline.tv/tv/motorsport/manx-grand-prix-documentary-on-itv4">Grand Prix
                Racer</a>).</p>
        <p>The official <a href="http://iomtt.com/">Isle of Man TT website</a> has a wonderful resource in the
            <a href="http://www.iomtt.com/TT-Database.aspx">TT Database</a>, which we used as our primary data
            source, and we wrote Python scripts to mine the data.  We concerned ourselves with showing line graphs
            per rider, per race class so that we could visualize how the rider has performed in a given race
            class.  When you mouse over a racing line in the primary visualization above, the line will turn black
            to call it out so that you can see how the rider has performed in the selected race class over time.</p><br />
